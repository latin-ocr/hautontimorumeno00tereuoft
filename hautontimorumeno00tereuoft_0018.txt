later times, and of which we may still see many
remains. Tacitus (Anu. 14, 20) tells us that be-
fore the building of Pompey’s theatre (more than
a hundred years after Terence's death) there had
been no permanent theatre at Rome. When
required at some religious festival, or some
funeral games, tiers of wooden scats roughly con-
structed, and a protemporary stage, were erected.
And there was an earlier period in theatrical
arrangements still, in which the spectators stood ⁴.
The scenery, if there was any, must have been
of the simplest description. At the best there
were two or more doors at the back of the stage,
representing the entrances to different houses.
The stage stood for the street, and as there could
be no representation of interiors, all the dialogue
had to be carried on there, which must often
have been a source of great restraint and awk-
wardness to the writer. The same scene too
had to serve for every place and every town
alike⁵ 3 and therefore the audience were called
upon for as much make-believe as Shakespear
says is necessary in a stage battleff. The shape

Quando alia ayetur, aliud siet oppidum.”

The scene of the Hautontimorumenos is in the
country. But the two country-houses are supposed to
be close together, and probably no alteration was made
or could be made to indicate the circumstance.

borate contrivances for scene-shifting, raising of the
curtam, etc. See virgil Geory. 3, 24-25, and Co-
nington’s note.
