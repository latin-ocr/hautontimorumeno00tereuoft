The fact is that the better classes in Rome
had always a misgiving that there was some-
thing degrading and effeminate in stage plays 3
a feeling which lasted till very late times, and
showcd itself in the disapproval felt by many
respectable pcople at the building of the first per-
manent theatre in Rome by Pompey². On the
other hand, the lower classes preferred the coarser
and more tangible ple· temes of the racc-course,

known at Rome for moie thu] three hundred
years after its foundation. Livy (7, 2) tells
us that the first exhibitions of the sort at Rome
were at a solemn festival proclaimed for the pur-
pose of averting a pestilence in Rc. 361. They
were at first, he says, only (lances without even
any expressive (lumb—show to give the specta-
tors an idea of a plot. N ext came rude songs
(versus F escennini) or coarse comio dialogue
between the (lances, not as yet with any idea
os a connected story, but in the way of rude
repartee. The next step was a connected song
sung to the tibia, a miscell-anemis composition
filled with personal allusions and references to
the various topics of the day. This was the
Satura.

The origin of these dances and songs was
Tuscan. &Vhen first introduced in Rome the
dances were performed by ludiones from Etruria3
afterwards native actors were employed who
called themselves histri ones, a word formed from
the Tuscnn hister on the analogy of ludio.

The first step towards dramatic dialogue was

a theatre. This will account for the entreaty for a quiet
hearing contained in all or nearly all the existing pro-
lognes to the plays of Plautus and Terence.
