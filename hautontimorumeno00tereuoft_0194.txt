36 THE SELF-TORMENTOR.

Acrr ΠΙ. Sc. 3.

Enter Onssmms and CLITIPHo conversinq.

Cn. What are you about, pray‘l what behaviour

is this on your part, Clitiphoz ought your conduct to
be of this kindz

CL. What have I done'l

CH. Did I just now see you steal your hand into
this courtezan’s bOSOln2

SY. [cosule] Itis all up with our plan: I am un-
done! CL. Me‘?

CH. Yes, with these eyes 5 don’t deny it. You
are doing a wrong to him in a way very unworthy of
you, in not keeping your hands off: for it is indeed an
insult 011 your part to receive one who is your friend
into your house, and then to make improper advances
to his mistress. For instance, yesterday during the
wine how uncontrolled you were—-

SY. [asida] It is all true.

CH. —lioW ill-behaved ἒ how afra-id I was for my
part as to what finally would come of it. I know

70 lovers : they notice with displeasure such things as
you would take no accoimt of.

CL. Ah, but Ι have credit with him, father, for not
being likely to do anything of that sort.

CH. Granted ε but at least retire hence somewhere
from the sight of them for some little space. Passion
makes many suggestions : those your presence forbids
his carrying out. I conjecture from my own experience:
there is not a single one of my friends to this day
