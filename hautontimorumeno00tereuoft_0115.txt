363. quos: ‘ what sort of people ! ’' qu0s=quazes.—W.
366. arte. cf. 226. noctem, Mayor on Iuv. i. 38.

368. gratissumum. Cf. supr. v. 262, note. hoc, i.e. her
coming to you in spite of many other solicitationS.

369. sis=si vis. The uncontracted si vis is found Adelph.
184. Its expressing a civil or peremptory request depende
on the tone in which it is uttered. Here it is somewhat
peremptory, a mixture of command and entreaty. vid. Rams.
Most. Exc. 13, p. 237. ruas, intransitive.

372. inuersa uerba...euersas ceruicis, ‘double entendres
and. side glances.' inversa verba is used 01 words of doubtful
meaning. Cf. Lucr. 1. 642, admirantur amantque Inversts qaae
sub verbis latitantia cernant. There is a play on the words
inversa, eversas hardly amounting to a pun.

373. abstine: ‘abstain from‚' more literally ‘keep at a
distance ’—the thing from which one holds aloof being ex-
pressed by the accusative. Cf. Plaut. Men. 5, 6, 17, ut culpam
abstineam. Triviam. 2, 1, 42, amor est abstinendus. The more
regular construction is the accusative 01 the person or part
held aloof, the ablative of the thing abstained from. Cf. 565.
Hecyr. 411, εᾶ me abstinuisse.

376. On Bacchis appearing, Clitipho forgets his bargain
and springs to meet her. Syrus holds him back. Hence the
exclamation, cur 'retines .²

her l ' saltem sine ut et salutem (tem.

380. Quid istic? ‘What about him?' pointing to Clinia.
istic for iste-ce, cf. illic 199.

Aer ΙΙ. So. 4.

It having been arranged that Bacchis is to pass as Clinia’s
love, and that Clitipho is to take himself off for a time out of
the way, Clitipho quits the stage, leaving Syrus and Clinia
together. Then Bacchis and Antiphila enter conversing.
After a short conversation between the women, Antiphila and
Clinia see and recognise each other: they greet each other
affectionately‚ and then Syrus hurries them all into Chremes-³
house, and the scene closes. The stage is apparently leit
empty for the first time, as it is again at the end 01 Act IV.

381. Edepol, ‘by Pollux,’ ‘in good truth,’ an oath said
to be originally confined to women, but it was afterwards at
any rate used by men also. v. Gen. 11, 6.
