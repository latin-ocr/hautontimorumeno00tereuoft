seems to call it ‘ fresh‚' cle. not used by any Latin poet before,
as an answer to the charge of not using his original fairly, but
making use of previous Latin adaptationS, a charge that we

5. Hauton timorumenon: this way of writing the word

7—9. W. omits these lines, and agrees with other com-
mentators who believe them to belong to the first prologue of

Hecyra.

13. Si is B’s emendation for sed. “He has put me for-
ward to plead his case, (and I shall do so) if only etc.’' a fa-
cundia, ‘ in the matter of delivery‚’ ‘with regard to delivery.'

every respect! Plaut. Mil. 631 St· albicapillus hic videtur,
