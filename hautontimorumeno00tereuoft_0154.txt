Clitipho seems to have believed what Syrus suggested, that

fore beseeches them to tell him who are his real parents. His
distress and repentance advance the eventual reconciliation
that takes place.

1029. hocine. ‘Can you really have asked me such a

distress serves to convince him 01 the fact.

1031. caue...audiam. Cf. 846, note.

1033. gerro, ‘trifler' connected with yerrae: ‘trifies’
(Ὑεῤῥαε ‘ wicker-work ’.) fraus ‘ cheat' is another instance of

1048. dixi. Cf. 937. Mi vir, obsecro te etc. Chremes
run-ms the two talents which he and Menedemus had fixed
e„ ⁴ ι, (940); but Sostrata supposes him to refer to the threat-
en· 12 settlement 01 311 1115 property on Antiphila.

1050. exorent, ‘to persuade by entreaty.’ Cf. Andr. 1, 1,
