90 NOTES.

402. quaero—qui restituerem. ‘While Ι tried to hit on
a plan for'restoring your son to you.' quaero is strictly an his-
torica] present, and the historical present is sometimes followed
by the imperi. subjunctive in the dependent clause. Cf. Virg.
G. iii. 359, Simul alta jubet discedere late Flumina qua juvenis
gressus inferret. Roby 1517.

500. arbitrum: διαιτήτην. The word must be explained
by reference to Athenian cwstoms, not Roman. At Athens a
certain number of public arbitrators were chosen from each
phylo, from whose decision there was an appeal to a regular
c0urt; but the parties might agree to select anyone they chose
to act as arbitrator, in which case there was no appeal. This
seems to be the case in the present instance: v. Hermann’s
Political AntIquit'z'es of (ἕνεκα, ἓ 145. For the Roman arbitri,
see Cic. Rosa. Com. ch. 4.

503. Chremes goes out, and re-enters at verse 507.

503. Ita comparatam, etc. ‘To think that all men's nature
ῗοῗὲ gssnjgiltuoed that, etc.’ For this use of the infinitive ef.

505. Parry quotes the lines of Menander:

οὐδεὶς ἐφ’ αὐτοῦ τὰ κακὰ συνορᾷ, Πάμφιλε,
σαφῶς, ἑτέρου δ’ ἀσχημονοῦντος ὄψεται.

511. congruere. The metm, as the line originally stood,
me nos inter nos congruere sentiam, requires commueret», which
supposes a form eoozqrueo, not otherwise known. Various
emendations have therefore been proposed. The real difficulty
is in the sense of οοηῃνῐιο, as Bentley points out; for it means
‘to be in harmony‚‘ concorditer vivere, not ‘plot together.’
Bentley wrote consentire, which Wagner says was not used
before the time of Cicero, and he rejects Bentley's quotation of
Plaut. Oasin. pr. 59 on the ,gu-onnd that it is not written by
Plautus, but by some one after Terence’s time for a fresh
representation. But he over-looks the fact that Bentley quotes
another passage, Pseud. 1, 5, 125, Quid si hice imer se consen-
serunt, which is not doubtful and fully justifies the use of the
word. However, I think in such a case the reading is to be
decided by evidence of what Terence wrote, not by conjecture
of what he had better have written. And so long as the mette
is satisfied it is dangerous to reject a word such as conyruere,
because its use is unusual and somewhat hard to justify, when it
is supported by all copies. Ne nosmet inter 7108 conyruere senti-
ant is a conjecture quoted by Bentley, and is a very slight
alteration, and the uosmet is very properly emphatic. “We
