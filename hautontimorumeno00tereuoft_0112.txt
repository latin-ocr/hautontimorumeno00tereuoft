80 NOTES.

mulla mala re asse expolitam muliebri. But though mala res
muliebris is intelligffile, esse has nothing to depend on, and
cannot be defended. It seems to have been introduced as
a means of filling up the metre, after the mistake had been
made of reading mala for malas. The Venetian edition of
1479 has mala. Madvig (Emendationes Latinae, p. 15) would
read nulla malas arte expolitam muliebri. But the emenda-
tion in the text is simplet. Madvig was not the first to see
that mala was a mistake for malas, and not the feminine
ablative of malus. The old commentatore explained it in this
way, and Fabritius proposed to read nulla re malas ezpolita
(-‹1m?) muliebri. Bentley got out of the difficulty (more suo)
by introducing interpolatam (Plaut. Most. l, 3, 145) for esse
expolitam; and Fleckheisen supposes a line to be lost; and in ‚
this Wagner follows him.

The whole passage should be compared with Phorm.

climax is in Terence's manner (see on 110). Fleck. reads

missus, circum caput. For sparsus there is the evidence of
Ausonius, Idyl. xil„ Totum opus hoc sparsum, crinis velut

better word. But the question is, what did Terence write?
not how might he have written better?

interrupt. Cf. 718.

297. sordidatam et sordidam, ‘ill-elad and ill-kept) sor-
diducam refers to the clothing‚ sordidam to the general condi-
tion of the maid’s person. The same distinction is marked
in the passage of Cicero quoted by St„ Pis. 99, nec minus
laetabor cum te semper sordidam quam si paullisper sordidatam
uiderem. Madvig (Ement‘l. Lat. p. 15) would read horridam.

299. internuntii, ‘go-betweens⁷: the plural masculine is
used because a class is spoken of, not a particular individual.
