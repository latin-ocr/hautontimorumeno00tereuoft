those accomplishnients over which the Muses preside& music,
poetry, even philosophy. Plato, ΡΙιωιῖο, ς· Ul, Alcibiud. 1,
108 c. Hunc: ‘ our author?

24. amicum ingenio, ι’. e. Scipio and Laelius (vid. Introd.
§7 note 14), the latter of whom especially was said to have
assisted Terence in composing his plays, Cf. Cic. Art. vii. 3

25. existumatio is here not merely an ⁶ opinion s‹›1·nied,⁷
but an ‘ opinion formed and express-eds a ‘ judcmentst Simi-
larly existimare-:⁴ to give a decided opinion! vid. Cic. Aeaci.
2, ἓ 126, Ne ezaedificatnm quidem hunc viandum diuino consilio
existimo,- atque haud scio an ita sit. ιΙ don't (as a sceptic)
express a decided opinion that the universe was so much as
constructedby divine desigm and yet 1 feel pretty sure that
such is the case) [1 may add that this use of arque goes to
show that the atqui for (tersiae 111 Andr. 525, adopted by 1³. and
W„ is unsouncl. Compare Adelph. 1, 1, 15, and Sallust -J. ss),
atque eyo scio homines, etc. ‘ And yet I know of nien. ...']

27. iniquom...aequ0m, isse. of his opponents and sup-
porters.

29. spectandi nouarum, ‘of seeing new plays) The usual
construction would be spwctmzdarum nouarum (sc. fabularum),
or spectandi 1101103. This irregulssr construction may be ac-
counted for by considering the gei-und as representing a noun.
Cf. Cic. Inu. ii. 2, menapiorum eliyemli Potestas‚· and other
examples cited by Zmnpt, ξ 661.

30. me. Luscius Lauinius, who we must suppose had
introduced an incident of this kind into some of his coniedies.
Terence’s objection is perhaps to the staleness of the johe, for
from other passages (in Eunuch. p. 36, Plaut. Amph. 3, 4. 4,
Mer-cat. p„ 108 and 1, 1, 7) it seems to have been a stock
scene. The serui currentis, ‘running footmen‚’ seem to have
been a distinct and well-known class.

32. decesse, ‘ make room for ε ’ a contractiori for decessisse.-
cf. insse for iussisse, 1001, inl'eze for {ulei-isse, Plaut. Merc. pr.
53, adposisse for aalposiuisse, Ter. And. 729. (Ie-*pere for (Ie.
spuisse, admisse 101· ‹ulniisixse Plaut. Mil. 147, 187. So adduxti
and dixti inf. 813. 830. Bentley read ‹la-cisse and translated
“represented the people as sa3·ing—‘ why serve a madman?’ '⁷
But from the passage in Plautus, among others, quoted above,
it is evident that decedo is the natural word in this connec-
tion, Mero. 1, 2, 7, Haec hic disciplina pessima est: currenti
properanti haud quisquam diqnum habet decedere. See Ellis
on Catullus 64, 268. The full phrase is decedere cle ιιία,
which occurs in Plaut. Amph, 3, 4,,1. cur insano seruiat?
