edition (1869) presents Fleckheisen's text with very
little variation‚ and is in fact a commentary upon
it. Many will be inclined to think that in these three
texts conjectura] emendation has been allowed to play
far too large a part. If so they may refer to ΜΓ
Parry's edition 111 the Bibliotheca Classica (1857) for
an example of the opposite extreme. It is hardly too
much to say that every alteration of the text is dis-
pleasing to Mr Parry, and almost every alteration

morseless pruning-knife is well known. It is with
considerable diffidence that an editor presumes to dif-
fer from a scholar of the immense learning and keen-
ness of Bentley. But few on the other hand would
always be bold enough to follow him 3 and it is impos-
sible not to feel that he alters at times from failing to
see the humorous point in his author's language. Not
seldom, too, he alters because the author might have
expressed himself better, much in the spirit of a master
correcting a boy's exercise3 and though perhaps he
improves what he alters, the one thing necessary, i. e.
the text such as Terence wrote it, is not always ob-

To form a satisfactory text of Terence, the first
thing necessary is a complete knowledge of the read-
ings of the Bembine MS. This I unfortunately have
not possessed. Many of these readings are given by
Bentley on the authority of Faernus 3 and W⁷agne1·
has given others from a copy of Poliziano's collation‚
