that his son has got money from him on Syrus’ false pretences
to give Bacchis. He promises Antiphila to Clinia, and signal
punishment for Clitipho and Syrus.

875. adJutor..‚momtor...praemonstrator: these words are
said to have been used in a special theatrical sense. [St. quotes
Phaedrus 5, 5, 13 in scaena postquam solus constitit, nullo ad-
paratu mollis adjutoribus] Their ordinary signification is suffl-
cient here. For monitor, cf. 171.

876—7. quae sunt dicta: Bentley read from certain mss.
dictae, because of the feminine antecedent rerum. But dicta
is the reading 01 the Bembine, and even 11 dicta sunt is a verb,
there is, it seems, authority for a neuter after res. St. quotes
Eun. 870 Narra rem omnem utfactum sit: [there however the ac-
cepted reading is narra omne ordine} But Ι believe that clieta is
here a neut. pl. substantive [as in 224,949]anc1 means ‘abusive
epithets.’ ‘Against me any 01 the abusive epithets used for a
1001 apply.' So Mart. 1, 4, 4 Materiam dictis me pudet esse
ducem, i.e. witticisms, or ‘ epigrams! And Cic. Phil. 2 ἓ 39, cle
dictis nihil respondeo„ in me quiduis...conuenit: Terence does
not elsewhere use this construction. But St. quotes Cic. Verr-
1, 49. in seems to have the force 01 ‘ against? caudex ‘ stem
of a tree,’ ‘ log 01 wood.’ Plumbeus ‘as heavy as lead.’ Cic.
Tusc. 1, 29, nisi plane inphysicis plumbei sumus. For a copious
list of the ternis 01 abuse used 111 the Comic Poets see Rams.
Aul. Excurs. 17.

879. ohe, ‘enough’ An exclamation of disgust and satiety.
Pers. i. 23, Azcriczclz‘s quibus et clt'cas cute perditus ohe! The
fun expression ohe jam satis occurs in Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 12.
Plzorm. 377, Olze desine adulescens. desiste Fleck. for desine.
Bent. hasjam desine Deus. The Bemb. inquam. gratulando:
‘ with your thanks,⁷ in E ιιη. 259, gratulari has the commoner
meaning of ‘expressing pleasure at.’ adventum yrcztulantur.
WVhen it means to ‘congratulate’ it takes the dat. 01 the person
illam saluta, et yratulare illi, Plaut. Truc. 2, 6, 31; and the
accusative 01 the subject of congratulation [mundantur eam rem
(mihi), Plaut. Capt. 3, 2, 5. In Plaut. Men. 1, 2, 20, it seems
to mean ‘ thanking' rather than ‘ congratulating.’

882. illic, i.e. in Menedemus’ house, Syrus had said, m‘hz'l
est illic quod moremur clintum, 834, and now their being so long
in the house where Bacchis is, has begun to make him

{ulslpicious ; and this prepares his mind for the revelation which

884. quae dixi nuntiastin: ‘Have you given Clinia my

message ?’ i. e. his consent to the marriage, which heimagined
was to be only sham. See 865.
