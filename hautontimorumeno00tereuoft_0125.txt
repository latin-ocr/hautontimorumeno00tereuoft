the Familia Rustica, and was sent 1ο the country...The sort of
toil most frequently referred to is working in the mills where
the corn is husked and ground (pistrimma—mola), and this task
was probably generally assigned to refractory town slaves, be-
cause no more skill was necessary than is required in turning
a modern treadmill or prison-crank.’' Ramsay, Most. Excur.
15, p. 256. Cf. Plzorm. 248, erus si redierit molendnmst in
pistrino. Plaut. As. 1, 1, 16, Num me illuc (lucis ubi Iapis lapi-
dem terit. Hor. Sat. 2, 7, 117, Ocius hinc te Νι rapis, accedes

second person ι ‘that friend of yourS.>

536. Garris (ληρεῖς) ⁵ you don’t mean what you say !’ .
538. quippini? :¹¹ of course.⁷' Madvig for qnippe qui.

540. Vel: ‘for instance,' cf. 806. The ΜΞ. reading is jam
Ιιιιῖο. This destroys the metre. Bentley remedied this by
reading huic jam; Fleck. by inserting vel. Chremes and Syrus
are at cross purposes: Chremes, while by these doctrines he
wishes to hint to Syrus the proper course to take in regard to
Menedemus, does not understand that his philosophy exactly
suits Syrus’ designs against himself.

541. illaec, an old form of illa, arising from the addition
of the demonstrative particle ce. Roby, ξ 374. It is the neuter
plural, as we had the nominative illic in 199. See note.

542. quo lubeat magis: ‘so that I have less qualms‚’ i.e.
in deceiving him.

544. tolerare ε ‘put up with,’ equivalent to sufferre V. 453.
The meaning given by Stalb. ‘provide for’ seems later. There
is no other instance of it in Terence. In Plaut. Aul. 4, 1, 12,
it means to ‘ relieve,’ ‘ support.’ And in Τνὶη. 3, 2, 61,
tolerare vnsusnia=ssto do your duty,” “to support your neces-
sary expenseS.”

Wagner reads the line

Abeat, quum hie tolerare ejus sumptus ozon queat,

because as it stands abeat and queat have different subjects,
‘the son’ and ‘the father? Bentley substitutes abissat for
abeat. But Fleck. keeps the MS. reading tolerare illius [not
hujus as W. says]; and Ι think this is safest. Illius refers to
Bacchis. Translate: ‘ [Is Dromo waiting] until he (i.e. Clinia)
run away again because he can’t stand the expense she puts
him to?' He supposes Clinia to be about to run away (or
rather he wishes Syrus to suppose it) because he fails to get
from his father money to supply the demands of Bacchis.
