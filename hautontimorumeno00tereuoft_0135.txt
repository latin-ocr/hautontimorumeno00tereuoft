to the interests of me and my master, Clitipho, in our turn.‘

690. Nequid de amica. senex. Clinia interrupts Syrus be-
fore he has finished his sentence, but what he was going to say
appears from v. 697.

691. Antiphila nubet mihi. Clinia seems afraid that Syrus'
schemes may prevent this, so he puts this in to show that he
will be a party to nothing that may retard the union. Or it
may be a mere lover's rhapsody.

fiet de aliquo, v. Adelph. 996.
