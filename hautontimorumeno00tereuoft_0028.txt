xxiv TIIE' LIFE OF TERENOE.

,-

1. After producing his comedies, before 110 had
completed his twenty-sixth year, for the sake of avoid-
ing the belief by which the productiori of the writings
of others as his own was attributed to him, or for the
sake of learning those habits and customs of the
Greeks which he had not so accurately represented iu
his writi11gs²⁴, he departed from Italy and never again
returned¹ Of his death Vulcatius ²5 has these lines ε

ὅ. “ But when the African had given six couiedies
“to the public, 110 made a journey hence into Asia,
“and after he had once embarked on board the ship‚
“ was never seen again ²⁶3 thus is 110 free of life.''

9. Quintus Cosconius says that he perished in
the sea on his return from Greece with a hundred and
eight plays translated from Allenmzder: others relate
that he died at Stymphalus in Arcadia or in Leucadia,
in the Consulship of Cornelius Dolabella and Marcus
Fulvius Nobilior [B. 0. 159]‚ having Sickened with
grief and disgust at the loss of his baggage‚ which he
had sent ficu-ward into the ship, and at the 8111110 time
of the new plays which he had composed.

10. Ηο is said to have been of middle stature, of

thiu person, of dau-k 00111111011101127. Ηο left a daughter,

“2⁴ Terence perhaps refers to this when he mentions that
one of the things said against him was that he had taken up
1110 profession 01 drainatist without due preparation (repente
ad studium hunc se adplicasse musicum, Haut. Prol. 23).

25 Vulcatius, see note 12.

2⁶ This seems only to mean ‘he never came back to
Rome.’

2⁷ The writer 0'1' the article ‘Terence,' in Smith’s Bioyra-
phieal Dictionary, remarks 011 this: “these are not the cha-
racteristics of the Punic race, but they accord with those of the
Libyphoenician or Celtiberiam perioeci‚ who were planted as
colonists in various parts of the Carthaginian territoryss’ And
though not much can be concluded. with certainty from such
arguments, it is very possible that Terence may by birth
have been one of these perioeei, and yet be denominated Car-
thayz'm‘emis, as he is by some Grammarians.
