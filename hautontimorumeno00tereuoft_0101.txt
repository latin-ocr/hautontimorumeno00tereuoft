NOTES. 69

62. sexaginta natus es. The Greek has been preserved:

πρὸς τῆς Ἀθηνας, δαιμονᾷς ’γεγονὼς ἔτη
recavo} ὁμου ’γάρ ἐστιν ὲ ζήκοντά, σοι. —W

65. siet: sit. Sim is a contraction of the form siem, sies.
siet etc. used by Pl. and T. Plautus also often uses the form
ζιιὲᾆιό, ᾅΖεὲ which Ter. only uses once (Hec. 610): see Roby

66. officia. fungere. This construction of funyor with an
accusative occurs again 111 580, and elsewhere throughout
Terence and Plautus. It even occurs 111 Lucr.1. 442. cf.
frui- ingyem'um, 401 It is constructed, however, with the abl.
3130, vid. Adelph. 603.

69. denique. B. following Donatus read, aut aliquid fa-
ccre denique : and Cicero quoting the lines (Fin. 1, 1) connects
denique with ferre. But denique sums up the assertion of
Menedemus⁷ being at work morning and night3 v. Munro⁷
Lucr. i. 17.

72. paenitet. ‘dissatisfied‚' for this sense of poenitet ci.
Ειιη. 5, 6, l2. Livy V. 9, poenitere m‹1{1i3tratuwn senatum ap-
parebat. Cic. Ac. 2, 22, 69, eum Mnesarchi& poenitebat? Was
he dissatisfied with Mnesarchus? enim: not used at the be-
ginning of 3 sentence except in the Comic poets.

76. ea quae nil: “and that too though they don't concern

you at all. '' Ι have followed W. 111 thus reading, instead of .

eaque nihil quae, etc. He compares for the irregularity of
construction 604.

f 77.l homo, used in its broadest sense of ‘one of the human
31111 y.'

78—9. In the two lines the order of the clauses 13 reversed 2
eqo ut faciam answers to percontari.- te ut deterream to mowers.
What Chremes said is an enquiry or an admonition, according
as Menedemus' conduct shall be shewn to be worthy of imita-
tion or blameable. ⁵ Tell me‚’ he infers, ‘ which it is to be.’

82. siquid laborist. This line 13 despaired of by many
critics. It 13 clear, I think, that Parry has made nothing os
it. Ι think it may be explained thus: Menedemus says mihi
with vis ible distress; Chremes observing it say‚s Oh if it 1
painful to you to speak 01 it I wish I hadn' t asked you (nollcm
- neollemfactum, cf. Ad. 165.-W.)‚ i.e. Ι am sorry Ι spoke.'
Then after a moment’s hesitation he goes on, ‘ but come ! you
had better tell me your sorrow.’ 1aborist=1abori est, the pro-
‹licative dative.

86. iuuero: ‘I shall be sure to be of some use.’ The
