child from the ground, and so give the signal for its being pre-
served and reared. Cf. 627.

Syrus is confounded by this discovery, which will prevent
his getting any money from Menedemus on the pretext of
redeeming her. After some thought he hits upon two ways
in which he can get the money which Clitipho wants to pay
Bacchis with. (1) If Chremes will only consent to pretend to
affiance Antiphila (the new-found daughter) to Clinia, Clinia’s
father will of course give money for necessary expenses. This
Chremes, imagining Clinia to be engaged with Bacchis, refuses.
(2) To maintain the story of the ransom asked for Antiphila
by Bacchis, who had had her (so he said, 599— 602) in pledge ;
and to appeal to Chremes' sense of honour to pay it. This
succeeds:

669. in angustum cog-untur copiae: my forces are hem-
med in, like an army in a narrow pass or cul—de-sac without
room to manoeuvre. Parry quotes a Greek line: εἰς στενὸν
κομιδῇ αἱ δυνάμεις ἐμοὶ καθίστανται. The Same metaphor is used
at greater length in Plaut. Mil. ‘Am—224, cf. Plaut. Cas. pr.
50, Sibi *nuum uterque contra leffiones parat Paterque filius-
que. oppido: ‘utterly‚' a word of uncertain origin, which
had become obsolete in the time of Quintilian (8, 3, 25). Do-
naldson (Varron. p. 112, 3cm Edit.) says that ‘⁶ op-pidzcm ‘ city '
is only ⁴ a plain' (ob-ped-um=e'7rtZ-7re60v); and oppido ‘ entirely’
:in toto, is synonymous with 1›lane.'‘ See Ellis on Cat. 54, 1.

671. postulem: ‘as to my expecting,' cf. 1011. Andr. 644

{tiam lozrzgzclng <lucere istis dictis postulas? See Ram. on Pl.
[ost. , , ;.

672. latere tecto. The most natural explanation is that
the metaphor of an army is kept up. ⁴ Like a general, I and
my forces (copiae, i. e. ⁴ my plans ⁷) are in a trap and. surrounded
by the enemy: my only triumph will ,be, not to beat the enemy,
