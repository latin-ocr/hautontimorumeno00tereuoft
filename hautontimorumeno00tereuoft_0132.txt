100 N OTES.

Madvig proposes to read natm.- 9ravior ⁶ naturally more sober.’
For which use of natus cf. 421, ingenio eyregyio ad miserias
natus sum.

646. Iustltia is ⁶ kindneSS‚' the putting a kindly construction
on an action, opposite to injustitia ‘harshness ' v. 134.

649. qua causa=cujus causa.

650. religiosae: ‘supe1·stitious,' ‘full of scruples.‘ Not
used elsewhere by Terence, though religio ⁶ a seruple’ occurs
several times, see on 228.

652. ne expers partis, etc. This is the idea of a Greek,
who thought it a crime that children should die without any
share in the fortune ot' their parents (Pattrick).

653. ‘You have saved the child by making it worth the
woman's while to keep it3 and at the same time you satisfied
your superstitious redings?

654. Hem quid, etc. Syrus is startled and says this aside.

658. Nescio, nisi ut, etc. : ‘I don’t know. Only I wish you
to enquire of the girl herself.' For the use of m'si cf. 542,
598. Plaut. Mil. 377, nisi mirum est facinus, ‘only it is an
astonishing thing.'

659. Si potis est reperiri: ‘ If it can be discovered) Pot'is
is indeelinable (perhaps invariably so in Plautus and Terence).
It is here neuter, as in Adelph. 521, 539 and Eunuch. 263 : cf.
Catuli. 76, 24 aut quod von potis est esse pudica velit, and 72, 7
Qui potis est? It is masculine in verse 321 of this play, and
feminine plural in Plaut. Poen. 1, 2, 17.

The neuter pote is found from Lucretius downwards, e. 9.
Catull. 67, 11. Persius, i. 56 Qui pote? vis dicam .2 There is
one passage in Terence [Adelph. 2643 and two in Plautus
[Mostell. 1, 3, 99. Aul. 2, 8, 20 (388)] 111 which pote has been
read, but in all three cases the reading is disputed, and many
mss. and editions read potest or potis. Donatus indeed in his
commentary on the passage of the Adelph. compares the form
viane for magis and calls it an ἀρχαιισμός. Maste however,
though occurring several times in Plautus, is not found in
Terence.

Of course if this discovery turns out to be true, Syrus' plan
for getting money out of Menedemus by persuading him to buy
Antiphila as a speculation, will fall to the ground; because if
she turns out to be Chremes' daughter it will be Chremes⁷
business to investigate and settle all claims against her.

662. cedo, ‘pray tell me,' see on 332.
