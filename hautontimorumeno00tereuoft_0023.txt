THE LIFE OF TERENCE

Translated from SUETONIUS¹.

1. PUBLIUS TERENTIUS the African, born at Car—
thage [B. o. 193]‚ was a slave at Rome to one Terentius
Lucanus, a Senator ⁹, by whom, on account of his
genius and good looks, he was not only provided with
a liberal education but was also early set free. Some
think that he was a captive, which Fenestella3 shews
could not possibly have been the case, since he was
born and died between the second Punic War and the
beginning of the third [i. e. between Β. C. 202 and
B.c. 141]: and that if he had been captured by Numi-
dians and Gaetulians, he could not have fallen into
the hands of a Roman Gener-al, since no intercourse

1 This life of Terence is given by Donatus (Donatus Aelim,
a Grammarian at Rome in the 4th cent. an.) and ascribed by
him to Suetonius; and it is accordingly often printed among
the fragments of that author's writingS. The genuineness
of it however has been doubted. It at any rate seems to be a
compilation of early rumours and scandals, facts partly known
and partly traditional, as to the life of Terence.

2 His full name was Publius Terentius Lucanus, from
which as was usual our poet took his nomen and praenomen
on manumission; his coynnmen Afer was probably given him
in allusion to his origin. But vid. ξ 10, note 27.

³ Fenestella, born B.c. 49, died Α. D. 21, a Roman historian
of the Augustan period. His chief work was his Annales,
in 21 books, known to us by the quotations from them in

Asconius, Pliny, A. Gellium etc.
