I have referred my readers from time to time
to the Latin Grammars of Zumpt (translated by
L. Schmitz, 3111 edition), Roby, and Key 3 and to the
Appendices of Ramsay's Ellostellaria, which contain
a mine of information as to the language of the comio
poets, though unfortunately left by their distinguished
author in a state of only partial arrangement. I am
afraid many students, especially the younger, seldom
avail themselves of references. But to teachers they
are often very valuable, and to them I commend such
as I have been able to supply.

The best commentary perhaps is a translation. But
its presence unfits a book for school use, and therefore
I have separated mine from the text and notes. The
biography is translated from Roth's text.

within the last eight years proposed a play of Terence
as a subject for exmuination, it is to be hoped that our
author may be more read than he has been of late.
Though a reader will find in him less broad fun than in
Plautus, and a student perhaps less instruction from
difficulties or peculiarities of language than is to be
found in the older poet 3 yet to a lover of quiet
humour and keen insight into character Terence will
always possess great charnis. Nor will he give less plea-
sure to those who enjoy a clear and pellucid style, and
