106 NOTES.

merely as a trick on the young man's part to get money from
his father on tho plea of his approaching marriage. Chremes
puts a stop to this pretended plan, as he thinks, by refusing to
cngage in the deceit so far as to make a sham engagement for
his daughter. But Syrus obtains his real object by getting
from him a sum of ten minae for the pretended debt due from
her to Bacchis: and even persuades him to send it by the
hands of Clitipho.

749-750, Menedemi uicem miseret me: tantum deuenisse
ad eum mali. ‘ For Menedemus’ sake I am sorry that so great
a misfortune should have befallen him.’ Miseret me has not
here the genitive of the person or thing pitied as in 260, where
it also means ⁴ Ι feel sorry’ without ‘for what' being expressed
(see note). Eveiywhere else in Terence or Plautus it has the
genitive of person or thing pitied expressed or understood, cf.
168, 463. Wagner would make vicem = fortunam, and says
that me miseret vicem ‘ Ι am sorry for his fortune ' is construc-
tion καταὶ σύνεσιν for misereor. But misereor does not take an
accusative except in late Latin, (see Pl. Capt. 3, 5, 107): and
ricem is here a preposition, cf. Cic. Fam. 4, 5, An illius vicem
doles? ‘Are you grieving for his sake?’ Liv. i. 25, Exani-
mes vicem unius se. Horatii, ‘ Terribly alarmed for the remain-
ing Horatius' sake) Roby §HOL For tantum mali cf. hoo
mali, 229.

751. familia is properly the ‘establishment of slaves’ (fa-
muli). The meaning of ‘family ’ in our sense is subsequent.

753. fuit: Bentley read est, but without good grounds. The
force of the perfect fnit is this τ ‘ Menedemus has felt (during
his son’s absence) such a desiderium for him, that he will put
up with anything at first.’ We must remember that desideri ιιηι
is a longing for, or feeling the absence of, a thing once but not
now in our possession (πόθος). ‘Now that the longing has
been turned into fmition,¹ Chremes says, ‘he wffl soon tire of
the expense.’

758. dari. ‘to be put in my way.’› Cf. Cic. Verr. 3, 19,
dare se populo, ‘ to present oneself to the people,’ ‘to appear.'

759. egisse: cf. 863.

760. dictum ac factum reddidi: ¹ It was said and done with
me,' lit. ‘ Ι made it said and done too.’ Dictum acfactum occurs
in 904, and Andr. 381, in an adverbial sense, equivalent to
‘instant1y.’ Our phrase is ‘ a word and a blow.⁷ It is from
the Greek ε see Hom. Hymn Herm. 46, ὠς ἅμ’ ἔπος τε καὶ ἔργον
ἐμήδετο κύδιμος Ἑρμῆς.

761. bona, i.e. fide, ‘on my honour? As Syrus is 1ying,
