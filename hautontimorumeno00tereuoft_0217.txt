ΒΙΕ. You would think that the fact still more, if 390
you knew better. CH. Say you so?

ΜΕ. Why, now listen.

CH. Stop a minute z Ι wish to know how much
you have lost first. For when you announced to your
son that she was betrothed to him, of course Dromo

there is not the least scent even of this woman being
Clinia’s mistress. CH. What say youCt
