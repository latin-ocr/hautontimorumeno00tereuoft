Char. 17 (‘the Grumbler') καὶ πρὸς τὸν εὐαγγελιζόμενον ὅτι “ υἱός
σοι ΎέὙονεν” εἰπεῖν, ὅτι “dv προσθῆς *καὶ τῆς οὐσίας τὸ ἥμισυ
ἅπεστιν’ ἀληθῆ ἐρεῖς.” “If some one announces to him as a
bit of good news ‘You have had a son born to you,' your
Grumbler will say, ⁴11· you were to add “And half your pro-
perty is gone '⁷ you would speak the truth.''’

630. tantam esse, etc. cf. on. 401.

632. equidem ego, 11 equidem=e90-quidem as is usually
said, is a pleonasm. Donaldson (Varron. p. 526) however
maintains that equidem is only a strengthened form 01 quidem,
as enim is of narn. Cf. adzerus, ε-ῃρίἱάιιε, e-castor (Hand Tur-
seZlInus, 2, 423). For a full discussion 01 this word, see Meri-
vale’s note to Sall. Catil. 51, where he quotes passages in
which equidem is constructed with the first person plural, the
third person plural and singular, the second person singular.
Cf. also Persius v. 45 N on equidem hoc dubites. The pleonasm (ἲ)
equidem ⁶⁷90 also occurs in Sall. Jugs. 10.

635. interemptam oportuit, sc. interemptam esse. Of. note
on 201, Plaut. Most. 747 non (attactam oportuit.

637. misericordia, etc: ‘You will plead pity‚ a mother⁷s
feelings. I allow the pleast

640. Per te, ⁶ as far as you were concerned‚’ for anything you
cared.' Quaestum faceret, ‘become a harlot,' cf. 447.

642. bonum atque aequom, or sometimes aequum bonum, is
a regular phrase for ‘equity,' ‘what is right and just.’ Cf.
Cic. Top. 17, illi aequum bonum tradiderunt ; also aequius
melius, ‘more justly and equitably‚’ Cic. Off. 3, 15. Phcz. 2.

645. Quanto tuos est animus natu grauior, ignoscentior:
⁴ In proportion as your mind is from its age more sober, more
indulgent, (so) let there be some protection for my folly in
your kindness.⁷ Natu yravz'or, like annis ssavis, aetate gravis,
should apply to a person3 it is unusual to apply it to animus,
but intelligible, indicating the Wise toleration that should come
with age. For the omission 01 a conjunction between yravz'or
and iynoscentior see 011 112. Iynoscentior is a participle used
as a frequentative adjective, ‘ prone to pardon.'

The line has been amended in various ways. Fleck. reads
quando for quanto. But it is so usual for the correlative 01
quantus to be omitted that there seems no necessity ior this.
Bentley wrote the line Quanto tu me es annis gravior, tanto es
ignoscentem. Few will be bold enough so entirely to re-write
their author. Others write nata grandior (Adelph. 930) 101·
9ναυίον. But gravior does not simply mean grandior here.
