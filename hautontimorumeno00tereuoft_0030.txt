xxvi THE LIFE OF TERENCE.

“and deserve to be, you lover of pure Latinity.
“Would that to your even—flowing style force had
“been joined! that your excellence as a Comic poet
“might have flourished in equal honour side by side
“ with the Greeks, and you had not been despised and
“lowly esteemed on this point. This is the only

“quality that Ι am hurt and grieved to think you had
“ not, Terence³².''

³² We are of course unable to judge of the correctness with
which the comparative merit of 'serence has been decided by
these writers, except in relation to Plautus. But the want
of ‘force’ complained of in Caesar we may criticise. Terence
was a ‘humourist’ 'm the right sense of the term3 i. e. he
depicted the humours—grave as well as gay—of mankind.
And whether his excellencies in this respect are mostly his
own or Menander's, in these six plays they appear very con-
spicuously. But the fame-writer and the author of broad and
palpable witticisms is ever more popular than the grave sati-
rist or the quiet humourist. Many will find endless enter-
tainment in a volume of Puneh or a modern farce, who will
see nothing in a volume of Sterne or Thackeray.
