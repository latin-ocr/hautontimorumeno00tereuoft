⁴2 THE SELF-TORMENTOR.

in fact you gave her every chance of life. But I say
nothing of that: pity, maternal feeling‚...1 allow all
that. Consider what excellent measures you took for
carrying out your intention: sor your daughter was

0 most obviously left by you entirely at that old woman’s

inercy, to become for anything you cared a hai-lot, or
to bc put up for public sale. You thought this I
believe ; ‘ I am content with anything‚ so long only as
she is kept alive.’ How are you to negotiate with
those people, who know nothing of law nor of what is
just and rights! VVhether a thing is better or worse,
advantageous or the reverse, they look at nothing
except their own will and pleasure.

So. Dear Chremes, I have done wrong, I confess
it: I give in. For the present Ι make this request of
you, that, in proportion as your mind. is the staider
from age, the more prone to pardon, there may be found
some protection for my foolishness in your indulgence.

CH. Of course as far as I am concerned I shall
pardon what you did : but, Sostrata, my easy temper is
a bad instructor to you in many ways. However, tell
me your motive, whatever it is, for entering upon this
tale.

SO. As you might expect from us women who are
foolish and miserably superstitious, upon giving the
child to that woman to be exposed, I draw a ring from
my finger, and I order her to expose it along with the
girl ; so that if she died she should not be quite
without share in our property.

CH. [ironically] That was excellent! you saved
yourself and her. So. This is the ring.
