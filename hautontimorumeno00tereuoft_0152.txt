120 NOTES.

989. uera, ⁴ a real daughter‚' not supposititious as you are.
Bent. wrote inventast vero. Perhaps we might put the comma

before vera, and take it with causa (et. 336). ‘ A plausible ex-
cnse!

996. faciam: ‘1 win do so? Clitipho goes off, leaving
Syrus solus.

998. This is Bentley’s reading from many mss. and is least
removed from the Bembine MS. Wagner reads after Fleck-
heisen nam quam maxume hnic vana haec suspitio, although he
eonfesses that he does not know on what authority such an ex-
traordinary change rests. 1 have preferred, in the absence of
better reason, to abide by Bentley’s milder alteration. situs is
not generally used of a person in a metaphorica] sense. Though
it is common in reference to things: cf. Plaut. Stich. 1, 1, 52,
in patris potestate situm est, ‘it rests with? Sall. J. 54, cui
spes omnis in fuya sita est, ‘is centred in.’

998. tam facillume. Bent. reads tam (lz‘fficz'llumae, explaining
that Syrus' object was to prevent a too hurried reconciliation
which would leave him to punishment. But Syrus wishes ior
the reconciliation, and trusts to the impression to be made on
Chremes feelings by the abject condition of Clitipho for the
latter' s success in making peace on his own te1m3, which would
of course include pardon for Syrus, ·—and this is what really
happens: see the two last lines of the play. in leges suas: on
his own terms‚’ cf. 1054, Ea leffe, ⁴ on this condition ;' and
hac le9e‚ Eun. 102. The metaphoris from a treaty between
military commandere.

1001. abripi, ile. ‘to punishment.' abripere, ‘to take
away forciblyz’ ci. Plaut. Mostell. 2, 1, amabo, abripite hunc
intro actatum inter manu& iusse for iussisse, see on 32.

1002. sem nostro fidei nil habeo, ‘ I won't trust him not to
have me piuiished!

Aer V. So. 3.

1003. homo: arespectful address heres ‘sm’ used by a

1004. adeo. Cf. note on 54.
