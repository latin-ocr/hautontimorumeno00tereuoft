88 NOTES.

4114. commetare: ‘frequent the company of! commeto
is a frequentative form of commeo,

446—448. This all arises from Chremes having mistaken
Bacchis for Antiphila.

446. coacta ingratus: another instance of Terencc’s man-
ner oi omitting n. conjunction in a climax. ‘ Forced, yes, against
her will‚’ see on 113. This, however, is a common phrase.

447. posinna, like praeterea, postea, etc. some consider to
be a corruption of postillam. Some regard illa as the ablative.
See Key, ξ 812, Roby, ξ 509.

448. Nunc answers of course to primum olim in v. 443. in-
tertrimento: intertrimentum is properly the waste of gold or
silvei· in working it (παράτριμμα). Of. Varr. L. L. 4, sub fin.
Intertrimentum ab eo quod <luo iuter se trita sunt ct deminuta .·
“ intertrimentum. so called because two pieces (of metal) are
rubbed together and worn down.” It hence was used generally
for any ‘loss, waste, or detriment.' Cf. Cic. Verr. 3, 50.

450. instructa ad perniciem, i.e. ‘taught by her experience
as a courtezan all the arts which can ruin a man.’ Cf. Plaut.
Bacch. 3, 1, 6, onmis ad perniciem instructa domus. Hcc. 203
(St.) doctae acl militiam.

451. plus decem ancillas: for plns used without affecting
the construction, ef. note on 198. Plaut. Τνίη. 2, 1, 28, gives
the retinue of a cmutezan, ‹lneitur familia tota: I'estispz'cac,
unctor, auri custos, flabelli—serae, scmdal'iyerulae, cantrices,
cistellam-tce& nunni, renuntii, ‘raptores panis et peni. Exactly
ten kinds.

452. satrapa (σατράπης); a Persian viceroy of a province.
Their great wealth‚—which the Greeks often had practical
proof of in the way of enormous bribes‚—ma<le their name
become synonymous for a great or rich man. Our use of the
word Nabob would perhaps represent it.

454. nedum: ‘to say nothing of your being able) The
conjunction nedum receives its meaning‘from the negative ne,
and accordingly governs the subjunctive. Zumpt, ἓ 573.

457. pytisando: ‘in tasting! Pytisso=⁷rvrzsem ‘to spit':
here, ‘to spit out wine after tasting.'· Cf. Juvenal xi. 175:

qui Lacedaemonium pytismate lubricat orbem: where see
'Mayor’s note.

459. sodes ‘please' was regarded by the Roman themselves
as a contraction of si audes: thus Cic. Or. 45, §154‚ Libenter
