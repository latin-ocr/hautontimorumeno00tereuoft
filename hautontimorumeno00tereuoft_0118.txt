(videsne quam blande ἲ). Its original meaning was, ‘I will
love you if you do what Ι ask.’ But it came to mean ‘⁶ Ι pray
you '' so completely as to take the construction of oro. Cf.
Eun. 537, Amabo ut illuc transeas, ‘I pray you to pass over
thither?

406. anime mi: ‘my darling! ' For various terms of
endearment found in the Comic writers see Ramsay's Mostell„
p. 280. These greetings are dull and commonplace enough
for two lovers so long separated ; but we must remember that
they are in company, and that Terence aims at representing
real life, and would avoid exaggeration3 the words therefore
are to be judged of by remembering how awkward and inane
first greetines usually are. Vt uales? ‘ How do you do? ’ No

Bacchis at the Coena, and found her avery exacting and expen-
sive guest. He comes out at daybreak to see Menedemus and
warn him of the ruinous expense coming 011 him if he permits
Clinia to associate with Bacchis. Menedemus ⁴comes out of
doors at the same time, not having been able to sleep for
anxiety and longing to his son.

Chremes persuades him to allow the young people by the
help of the slaves to cheat him out of the money they want
rather than give it them openly. By this means some limit
will be put to the expense.

They enter from different doors, and in such manner as not
to see each other at first. From 410—420 Chremes solilo-
quizes: 11 0111 421—426 Menedemus also soliloquizes.
