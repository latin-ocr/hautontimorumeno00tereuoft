:32 THE SELF-TORMENTOR.

ΜΕ. Give me your hand: I beseech you, Chremes,
to go on doing the same.

Cn. I am ready.

ΜΕ. Do you know what Ι want you to do?

CH. Tell me.

ΜΕ. Since you have perceived that they are be-
ginning to trick me, see that they make haste and do
it: Ι am longing to give him what he wants‚ Ι am
longing to see himself this moment.

CH. I will 566 to it. A little piece of business
detains me at present: our neighbours Simus and

5⁴ ³ Crito here have a ‹lispute about boundaries 3 and they

have chosen me arbitrator. Ι will go and say that I
can’t attend to them ‘to-day, as Ι had told them that I
would. I will be with you immediately.

ME. Do so I beg. [Em CHREMES] Gods, to
think of it! that all men's nature is so constituted
that they see and decide other people's affairs better
than their own ἶ Does it arise from the fact, that in
our own affairs We are hampered by excess of joy or
sorrowffi¹ How much more acute this man is in my
interests than I am in my own ἒ

lie-enter CHREMES.

CH. I have released myself, so as to be at leisure

to attend to you. Ι must catch Syrus and give him a

Jzolecture. [The door of CHREMES⁷ house is opened.]

Some one is coming out of my house : retire hence to
your own house, lest they perceive that we too have
a mutual understanding. [Exit MENEDEMUS.
