118 NOTES.

he has informed of Chremes’ anger and consequent determi-
nation to disinherit his son. They appeal in vain to Chremeti,
who declares that he does it for Clitipho's good, to prevent his
being ruined by Bacchis, and that he is not going to punish
Syrus any further than leaving him to take care of himself.
He leaves the stage after v. 977. And then Syrus suggests to
Clitipho that the real reason of this is that he is not really the
son of Chremes and Sostrata, who having found their real
daughter take this pretext for (liscarding him. Clitipho goes
off (v. 996) to beg his parents to tell him the truth. Syrus left
alone explains that he has made this suggestion not because he
believes its truth, but that Clitipho's distress may effect his
reconciliation. He does not however expect to get off so easily
himself, and on seeing Chremes coming he runs off, and does
not appear again.

As Syffus runs off, Chremes with his wife Sostrata eomes on.
She is remonstrating with him 011 his severity to Clitipho, and
begging him to forgive his son. ‘Seel’ she says, ‘you have
already induced him to believe himself a foundling.' ‘Never
fear,⁷ he retorts, ⁶ he is so like you in character that he will be
always easily reoognised 1 ’

To them enters Clitipho in great distreSS. He entirely ac-
knowledges his faults and entreats to be allowed to atone for

them.

caseS. Nisi does not indeed here and in similar passages in-
troduce a correction, but it introduces a new sentence which
contains a modifiedform of the statement ¹in the previous one.

960. Clitipho comes in talking to Menedemus.

961. quidquid huius: ‘whatever of what I have done,' cf.
Eun. 980, Quidquidfaetum est, culpa non factumst mea.

962. animo omisso. St. quotes Adelph. 830, At enim metuas
ne ab re sint tamen omissiores paullo.

963. consulerem longitudinem: in lonyitndinem. lit. ‘length-
wise‚' is here somewhat strangely used for in futurum. St.
quotes Tacitus, H. 2, 95, in longius consultare.

964—8. The upshot of it all is that Chremes pretends to
have settled all his property on his daughter, so that Clitipho
will be dependent on her for his livelihood.
