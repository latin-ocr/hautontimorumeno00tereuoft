pendently.

taire< ‚ etc.

1062. Caesiam. Caesia oorresponds to the Greek Ὑλαυκή.
As γλαυκῶπις is the epithet of Athene, the young lady need not
have been insulted perhaps. But it had come to mean what
we eall oat-eyed. Catull. 45, 7, caesius leo. Cf. Luor. 4, 1161,
Caesia Palladium? i. e. ⁶ if our mistress has oat’s eyes, we call

1067. Ω is said to stand for Cantor, who when the aotors
had retired laid down his tibia and spoke last, and thus
terminated the play in his own person. Bentley supposed it to
have come from a corruption of the letters CA standing for
Cantor. Wagner thinks that it arose from the fact that in
the Mss. the characters were marked by letters of the alphabet,
and that Ω as the last letter stood for the last speaker. It
seems to have been the invariable way of ending a play. Cf.
Hor. Ars P. 155, donec cantor, ‘Vos plau(lite‚' dicat.
