966. abii aa proxumos. Though Chremes means his
daughter he uses the plur. maso„ because he purposely means
to be vague, and when speaking in general tel-ms of a person
or persons the masc. plur. is used, cf. 151, 298, 383. Fleckh.
reads ad proximum (Clinia) tibi qai erat, ei etc.

969. satius est etc. ⁸ It is better so than that by your suc-
ceeding to it Bacchis should really have possession of our pro-
perty? Possidere is used here accurately of the person who
has the actual enjoyment of property, though the dominium or
absolute legal ownership may be in another person. So figu-
ratively of using a name which is rightly another’s, Plaut. Mil.
2, 5, 27, falsum nomen possidere, Philocomasium, postulas.
haec: ‘this property of mine.y Cf. Eun. 119, hospes—qui mihi

971. Emori, ⁴ to die out of hand‚' ‘ at once! See Merivale
on Sall. J ay. 14. uiuere, ‘really to live,‘ ‘to live a life which
may properly be so called.’ This use of uiuere is common in
Martial, c. 9. 2, 90, 3, 4, Viuere quod propero pauper nec inutilis
annis, Da vcniam; properat uiuere nemo satis. Only by a
‘ proper use of life,' Martial means ⁶ enjoyment,’ Chremes
means ‘ moral conduct.'

972. istoc utitor: ‘follow your own plan of life‚’ cf. Hor.
Ep. 1, 6, 67, St quid mouisti rectius istis, Candidus impera]
si non his utere mecum.

974. huic, i. e. Clitipho, ilicetzi-licet‚ ‘ go! you may.’ Cf.
scillcet, 358.

975. aram 1100 precatorem: an altar to fly to for refuge, to

escape punishment3 01· a friend to beg him off. Instances are
quoted from Phorm. 140 f. ; and Plaut. Mostell. 5, 1, 60 1.

977. 1100 uos est etc. The full sentence would be, nec uos
aequum est succensere mihi ob id, quod facio.

979. tibi iam etc. ‘For you I understand there is living
provided at your sister's house!

980. a. fame: Bentley for fame. He compares Hecyr'. 736,
nil tibi est α me pericli, mulier. rediisse, 01. 011 926.

983. ibi, ⁶ engaged in that) Cf. 472, subsensi...illos ibi esse.

984. non aberit longine, i. e. “ consiliam, ‘ I shall soon have
an idea.‘ ’‘—W. Cf. 668.

986. quod. mihi in mentem, sc. venit: cf. 890.

988. te indulgebant. Terence usually has indulyere with
the accusative, instead of the dative. v. Eun. 222 ; Adelph. 63.
Though before (861) we had nimium illi indulyes.
