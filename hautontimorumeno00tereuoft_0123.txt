know that they have an understanding between them, don't
let them see that there is one between us.'' For nos ‘nosmet cf.
Pl. Truc. 1, l, 38.

The use of a word milder than the sense requires is a very
common characteristic of comic language; it is not therefore
unintelligible that when Chremes means ‘plot together’ he
should only say ‘get on together.' So in 420 obsequi ‘show
courtesy to’ or ‘ give in to* is used when he means ‘ do a good
turn to’ or ‘serve the interest of.' Might it be suggested to
read Ne uos inter ‘nos covzyrttere senes sciant, comparing 417
and 420? [Menedemus now leaves the stage]

Acr ΠΙ. Sc. 2.

Menedemus re-enters the house, leaving Chremes on the
stage alone. To him enters Syrus, whom Chremes imme-
diately instructs to act with Clinia's slave Dromo to carry out
the plan he had suggested to Menedemus, zze, to get money
out of Menedemus by apparent trickery. Syrus had in his
head a plan for cheating Chremes himself out of some money
for Clitipho. He therefore warns Chremes that he is not to
be over much enraged if some day his lessons are turned
against himself.

512. inueniendum es. Bentley for est: he explains that
Syrus is addressing the money which he has not got. Cf. 4, 2,
11, Retraham hercle opinor ad me idem illud fuyitiuum ar-
yentdm. Syrus sayS‚ ‘Dodge me as you will, I must catch you,
friend money Γ

513. intendenda, metaphor from 10113 stretched to catch ani-
mals. Rams. Most. ΕΚΘ. p. 272.

514. We must suppose Chremes again concealed by the
opening door from the slave who is coming 0111.

516. Chremes still does not understand that he himself is
the viatim of Syrus’ plots. prouincia, contracted from prori-
lencm, is any office or charge entrusted to one. Cf. Cic· Sall.
18, sibi provinciam depoposcit ut me 111 meo lectulo trucidaret,
‘the office of killing me.' Cf. also Plaut. Gapt. 3, 1, 14, pro-
vincia parasitomun, ‘the business of the parasites.'

518. Quid tu, se. agis: ‘How are you?’ seems to expect an
answer more than the common greeting Vt uales ‚2 (406). See
Pl. Caro. 2, 1, 20, Sulcato. Quid aqi-s? CA. Vivo.

518. Recte, ‘oh! all right 1’ Syrus tries to turn the subject,
to avoid awkward questions from Chremes. See on 228.
