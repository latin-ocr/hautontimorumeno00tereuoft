Is what you do right 2 —that I may do it myself. Is
it not so Z—that I may deter you.

ΜΕ. Ι am obliged to do so: for yourself do what 30

your trouble, whatever it is ε don’t keep it quiet, don't
be afraid: confide in me, I tell you: Ι shall be sure
to be of some use to you either by consolation or
advice or by actual help.

ΜΕ. Do you wish to know this?

CH. Yes, for the reason which I have stated

ΜΕ. It shall be spoken.
