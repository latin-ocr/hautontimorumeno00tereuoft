342. in aurem utramuis...dorm1as: ‘ So that you may eleep
at your 01156 011 whichcver ear you please.’ This proverbial ex-
pression means to be in perfect security. Comp. Plaut. Pseud.
1, 1, 121, Ρ5. (Ie istac re in oculum utrumvis conquiescit. CA.
Oculum anne in aurem? Ps. At hoc pervolyatum est nimis.
Ps. ‘He’s sleeping on either eye in that matter.’ CA. ‘You
mean either ear, don’t y0u?’ ΡΒ. ‘Oh, that's too hackneyed
an expression) This proverb 15 referred to by Pliny (Ep. 4, 29)
mihil est quod in dextram aurem fiducia mei domnius. And
Facciolati quotes the Greek ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα τὰ. ὦτα καθεύδειν.
For the sense of dormiunt, ef. 731, where dormiuntz‘ they feel
secure.' We have a proverbial expression of an opposite
meaning, “to sleep with one ear open.”

Patrick). Cf. 564.

357. neglectu for neqlectui, ‘ this 15 110 matter for neglect,'

this form also occurs several times in Caesar, who is said by
Gellius (4, 19) to have sanctioned it exclusively. Zumpt, ἓ 81;
Lucil. fr. 135, anu noceo, though inf. 640 we have anui.

358. scilicet facturum, ‘Of course I will do so.' scilicet
has here the construction which its composition properly war-
rants: either sci-licet, ‘know‚ you may3' or scire-licet, as
Lucr. writes it, ii. 809. Cf. 856 and 892.

titubes mandataque franyas.
