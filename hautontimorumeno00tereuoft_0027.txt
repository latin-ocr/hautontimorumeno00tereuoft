come into the dining-room at a late hour, he said. that
he had not often been so happy in con1position3 and
that then upon being asked to produce these composi-
tions‚ he recited some verses which are in the Hau-
. tontimorumenos, beginningffl: ‘⁶ Well I'm sure, Syrus'
“ promises have enticed me here in a pretty impudent
‘⁴ manner.⁷'

6. Sautra²⁰ thinks that Terence, if 110 really did
want helpers, would have been able to avail himself
not so much of Scipio and Laelius as of Caius Sul-
picius Gallusffl, a learned man and the person 111 whose
Consular ganies he made his debut in producing
comedies, or of Quintus Fabius Labeo ²² and Marcus
Popillius23, both men of Consular rank and poets 3 011
that account it was that 110 himself did not indicate
young men as those said to help him, but men “of
“whose conduct in war, in peace, (md in public busi-
“ ness’' the people have had experience.
