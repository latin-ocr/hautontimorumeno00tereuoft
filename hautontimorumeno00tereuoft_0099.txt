NOTES. 67

Two ways are adopted of explaining these words, 1. By
making seruus the subject of seruiat: ‘what is the point in
the slave having a mad master, which he must have if he
has to rush about in this way?' 2. By making populus the
subject of seruiat: ‘why should they (the people) be at the
mercy of a madman, and make way humbly for him?' The

latter seems the better of the two ; but there is 110 great point
made by either.

36. Statariam: fabula stataria is a play which involves
little action, but is conducted principally by the dialogue.
The word was also used of orators who spoke without vehe-
ment motion and action. Cf. Cic. Brut. 30, 116. per silen—
tium, of the audience. Vid. Introd. ἓ 1.

37—39. The usual characters which made up the dramatis
personae of the Latin Comedies. parasitus—(wapa'mros) *a
dinner guest '-is always introduced as a sponger who will do
any dirty work for a dinner. sycophanta (συκοφάντης) is used
as a general term for a raso-al, while the parasitus is the
shabby-genteel hanger-on.

41. causam iustam, still keeping up the idea of speaking
as an advocate in a law-court.

45. ad alium defertur gregem, ‘it is taken to some other
company to act! The Roman actors were a distinet 01383, and
were not included in the tribes or possessed of other rights of
citizenship. A certain number of them formed themselves
into a company under the headship of some leading actor,
such as Ambiuius, and thus formed a grex or company which
always acted together. See Introd. ξ 4. He is really proud
of what he pretends to grumble at, and alludes elsewhere to the
actor's services in seeuring the success of a play. See Hecyr.
prol. 20—4‚ Phorm. prol. 9—10. lenis, ‘light and easy,' i.e.
involving little action, and depending chiefly on dialogue ; and
so less fatiguing to the actors.

46. Lu hac est pura Oratim ‘ In this play the attraction is
its purity of style,' i. e. not its action. Ambiuius is contrasting
the bustling‚ stirring plays in which he has often acted with
this quiet (stataria) and more refined drama, where the beauty
of style and language is the main feature. For this meaning
of oratio, vid. Phorm. prol. 5, Fabalas...tenai esse oratione.
Cf. also Cic. Orat. ii. 13, res oratione illustrantur, i.e. put in
a clear light by the beauty of the style. The exact meaning
of pura seems to be 3 combination of ‘ clea1·‚' ‘simple,’ ‘na-
turaL' Not ‘ pure ' in the sense of ‘ correct.' Caesar, in
calling Terence puri sermonis amator, seems to be referring to
