104 N OTES.

716. aetatem : used adverbially for per aevum, or in omnem
aetatem. Cf. Plaut. Cure. 4, 3, 22, αι tn aeyrota, si luhet‚per
me aetatem quidem. malum, ⁴ You rascal‚' cf. 318.

719. quid. si nunc coelum ruat? A proverb to express any
wild improbability. W. quotes an answer given by the Celts to
Alexander, that their greatest sear was μήποτε ὁ οὐρανὸς αὐτοῖς
ἐμπέσοι, meaning Ι suppose that they feared nothing in the
world. Horace may have had some such proverb in his mind
when he wrote, ‘si fractus illabatur orbis Impaviclum ferient
ruinae,’ ‘whatever missortune however unlooked sor and im-
probable happen to him.’ Cf. Lucian Prom. 192, διὰ τοῦτο
ἐχρῆν τὸ τοῦ λόγου τῇ ’γῇ τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀναμεμῖχθαι. Comp. the
phrases caelum ac terras miseere Livy iv. 3. Virg. Aen. 1. 133.
Juv. ii. 25. mara caelo confundere Juv. vi. 282. Caelum z'n
Tartara solvere, Virg. Aen. xii. 204.

Aer IV. Sc. 4.

Bacchis is impatient for the promised money. Syrus quiets
her with promises and induces her to go to the house of Mene-
demus. The opening lines of this scene were said to have
been by Laelius. See Life ἓ 5.

724. decem minas quas 1111111 dare pollicitust: ‘ Namely the
ten minae which he promised to give me.’ Minas seems to be
111 appositior] to promissa but to be attracted into the case of
its relative quas. It is a harsh construction, and is not exactly
paralleled by Andr. 3, which St. quotes, populo ut placerent
quas fecisset fabulas, where the order of the words makes all
the difference. W. seems to take it promissa...clecem minas
⁴ his promises about the ten minae.' But this is harsher still.

727. pendebit animi: ‘ he shall be fluttering in heart with
expectation.' aui-mi ‘in respect ot' mind.² Cf. Virg. G. 111. 289,
dubius animi. G. iv. 491 vietus animi. Lucr. 1. 137. Eun.
274, falsus animist. Many other instances will be found
quoted by WVagner 111 1115 note to Plaut. Aul. 105: and by
Roby ξ 1321, who explains the usage as arising from several
sources, viz. the locative 1156 of (mimi, the objective genitive,
the genitive of the secondary object, and perhaps the Greek
usages. See Munro on Lucr. i. 137. where he shows that the
use is not confined to animi. XVagner rejects the theory ol' its
being derived from the Greek use3 and Key [ἐ 935, note] argues
that animi is in truth a dative, and that the use of the genitive
in other words by later writers grew out of a false analogy from
αηιηιί.
