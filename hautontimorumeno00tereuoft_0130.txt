98 NOTES.

of little trinkets given by relations and servants at the lustratio
(9 days aster birth of boys, 8 after that of girls), and on its sub·
sequent birthdays: v. Bekk. Gallus, ΕΚΘ. 11. p. 183}

617. ut contemplata sis, ‘Be sure you have examined it
sufficiontly,' vide ut contemplata sis. Cf. 741.

620. Chremes seems to have a very low opinion of his wife’s
good sense: ‘Oh‚’ he says, ‘it's all about nothing you may be
sure: she always makes a fuss about nothing) non temere
est; ‘it is not for nothing,' an idiomatic phrase, for non temere
estfactum. Cf. Plaut. Aul. 4. 3, 1, 71οη temere est qaod coruus
cantat mihi ab laeva mana. Eun. 291, Non temere est; et pro-
peratas venit: nescio quid circumspectat.

621. dixerit: ‘She will have some mighty nonsense to
say.' The more common phrase is nufias affere, cf. Plaut.
Poen. pr. 81. For the tense, cf. note on 86.

625. portat, ‘brings with it,’-⁶ implies ' or ‘ portends.

627. tolli. When a child was born alive, it was laid on the
ground, and the father if he wished it to be brought up lifted (tol—
lere) it from the ground 3 if he left it there it was exposed. At any
rate if the custom of exposing infants was not prevalent in the
time of Terence, the old ceremonia] was still kept up. Cf.
Varro, 12, 36, Natas si erat vitalis ac sublatas ab obstetrice,
statuebatur in terra ut auspicaretur rectus esse. v. Bekk.
Gallim, Exo. 11. p. 183. It is referred to twice again in Terence,
Andr. 219. Hecyr. 571.

628. Sic est factum, domina: ergo erus damno auctus est.
‘No doubt of it, Madam; so my master has been blessed by
an addition to his family of—an expense! This is the
MS. reading and Ι do not think it improved by Bentley who
writes minor erqo herus ‘my young master,' i.e. Clitipho: re-
ferring to his loss of fortune by the discovery of a sister and
the consequent division of property. What Syrus is thinking
of at the moment is the new expense to his master Chremes,
who will not only have to bargain for this daughter with some
covetous old woman, but pay for all the usual expenses of a
young lady. Cf. Plaut. Mil. 698, Haec atque horum similia
alia damna mulierum me prohibent rmaore. Again, auctus est
is used especially of an addition to one's family by the birth
of a child, and so applies more properly to Chremes, ef.
