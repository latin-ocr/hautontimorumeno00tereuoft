AOT ΙΙΙ. SCENE l. :31

ME. What am Ι to do‘l

CH. Anything rather than what you are thinking
of doing: give it through the hands of anyone else:
allow yourself to be duped by tricks through the 470
agency of some servant-lad3—although I noticed this
too, that they are on that tack and are plotting
together on the sly. Syrus is whispering along with
that fellow of yours 3 they are communicating their
designs to the young men : and it is better for you to
lose a talent in this way than a mina in the other. It
is not now money that is the question, but in what
way we can give it to the young man with the least
risk. For if he shall once have understood the state
of your mind,-—that you are prepared to sacrifice your
life and all your money, sooner than lose your son 480
from your side 3 dear me, how wide a loop-hole for
debauchery will you have openedl While for yourself you
will have made it impossible henceforth to live with
any pleasure. For we all grow worse by absence of
control. [YVhatsoever occurs to anyone's mind, 110
will want to have, and will not consider whether it be
right or wrong] You will not be able to stand the
ruin of your property and himself. You refuse to
give: straight he will have recourse to that which he
will perceive has the greatest weight with you: he
will immediately threaten to leave you.

ΜΕ. You seem to speak the truth and exactly as 490
the matter stands.

CH. Indeed, for my part, sleep has not visited my
eyes this past night, while Ι was trying to hit on a
plan for restoring your son to you.
