aedes uenales hasce inscribit litteris. merces is used for the

31; and. some read. inscripsi mercede, sc. conducendas, i.e.
⁴ to let.’

147—8. tantisper ...... dum: ‘just so long as) Here tan-
risper like usque, v. 136, strengthens and defines ᾱιιηι. Cf.
Pla-ut. Most. 3, 1, 15, tantisper dum exis te opperiar foris.

148. fiam. Madvig would read uiumn, saying, “von dum
fit Menedemus miser, iniuria filio facta minuitur, secl (lum est '²
(Emend. Lat. p. 14). But Wagner seems right in explaining
fiam as a middle, “ so long as Ι make myself.’'

miser refers not to distress of mind so much as to a scanty
and laborious manner of life. Cf. Plaut. Aul. pr. 14, αῃνί
reliquit ei non maynzcm modum Qui cum labore magno et misere)

happens when people are not living 011 terms of sinoerity.'
Bentley's emendation for hocque, which is unmetrical. I have

tion. Cf. Iuv. v. 18, ⁴ una simus ' ait.

165. hinc pepulerim. Bentley. Fleckh.—metri causa, for
impulerim. Faern, impellerim, a form unknown.

169. monere oportet : I have restored the old reading instead
of tempust monere of Bentley, whom Fl. and W. follow. It is
too great a change without better authority. ibo, uisam. 010.
