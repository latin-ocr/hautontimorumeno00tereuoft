Cf. Plaut. Amph. pr. 131, Pater mmo intus suo animo morem
yet-it, ‘is gratifying his own inelinations! ib. 3, 3, 26, mihi
morigero ‘ I indulge my desires.'

948. arcessat. ‘Let him take her home.' “The cere-
monious fetching of the bride from her paternal house to that
of the bridegroom, called deductio, took place in all kinds of
marriages, without, however, being necessary. This ceremony
regularly occurred in the evening.”—BEKK. Gall. Exc. 1, p. 160.

948—9. This is exactly as Syrus had feared. Vid. 355-6,
hic si quid nobis forte adversi euenerz't, Tibi enim parata uerba,
haic homini uerbera.

949. confutabitur: ‘ shall be put down.’ C'onsntare is literally
‘ to prevent water from boiling over by pouring in cold.' Hence
⁴ to oheck,‘ and thirdly, ‘to put down by words.' Cf. Phorm. 3,
l, 13, confutant uerbis admodum iratzmz patrem. (Donaldson.
Varron. p. 446, connects it with sutis ‘a water vessel,’ and
fundo, ef. the derivation of effutio. Cf. W. on Phorm. 746.) Cf.
Cic. Taso. 5, 31, confutare dolores, ‘to repress or keep down
sorrows.‘ W. points out that it keeps up the metaphor of di s-
fluit in v. 72.

950. exornatum dabo, lit. ‘ Ι will render him dressed! For
this use of erm-natus Parry compares Plaut. Rud. 3, 4, 25, ita,
hinc ⁶³90 te ornatam amittam, {lc 'ipsus te non noveris. And foi·
depexum ‘eurry-combed’ Plaut. Capt. 4, 2, 117, Nam hercle
nisi mantiscinatus probe ero, fusti pectito.

952. deridiculo: a subst„ ‘a subject for his derision.⁷ Β.
substituted deridiculo for ridiculo for the sake of the metre.
Elsewhere Terence uses mulcatum,- but Plaut. (Amph. 2, 2, 5)
uses the word.

953. uiduae mulieri: ‘So help me heaven, he wouldn’t have
dated to do to a lone unproteeted woman what he has done to
me.' uidua mulier is not necessarily what we call a ‘ widow,'
though it means that among other things. It is any woman
without a legal male protector, ἰ. e. husband. When this was
the case she was obliged to have her rights represented by some
official guardian. Accordingly we find that uiduae pay a tax,
Livy 1, 43; Cio. de Rep. 2, 20. In Plaut. Men. 1, 2, 4. 5, 1, 20
and Plzorm. 913, it is applied to a divoreed woman. And in
Plaut. Stich. 1, 1, 2 Penelope is spoken osas qva} mm diu uidua
suo caruit. (Weise however here rejects the word uidua.)

During Chremes' last angry speech Menedemus has gone
into the house and now returns with Clitipho and Syrus, whom
