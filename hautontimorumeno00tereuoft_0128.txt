96 NOTES.

585. Cf. 302 with 5⁵³4, effecero ‘Before I have got the
money out of him.’ ‘ Chremes, will you take a sool‘s advice?

588. Deambulatum ‘to take a walk‚' cf. deambulatio 806.
It seems to be the word for taking a set walk for exercise,
whereas ambulare refers merely to the action of walking. Quum
satis deambulatum eric quiescemus, Cic. Leq. 1, 3, 14.

591. censen uero. It is not likely that Clitipho gives Syrus
‘ a summary castigation‚' as Pal-ry says, in his iather’s presence,
but he probably makes some threatening gesture, to which
Syrus tauntingly says Censen vero? ‘Would you ‘though' in
our slang phrase.

593—4. This high moral tone Syrus of course adopts further
to blind Chremes.

595. tecum egi. ‘1 talked to you about.'

596. Aut est is Bentley's emendation for repperisti, which
makes the line too long by a foot. Fleek. adopts it and no-
thing better has been proposed. Transl. ‘Have you hit on
anything satisfactory, or have you not done so yet?’ Nondum
etiam, ‘not yet.5 The combination is common in Terence [see
Andr. 201, 807. Hecyr. 192, 745 ]. But sometimes nonduin stands
alone. Phorm. 147, DA. Pater ejus rediit an non? GE. non
dnm. Sometimes dum is omitted. *nunqnam etiam Eun. 1092.
hand etiarn Plaut. M ῖ I. 1400. Sometimes the order is reversed
neque etiam (lum supr. 230. In these cases (lum partakes of
the nature of an enclitic, not exaotly reprodueible in our lan-
guage. It is often joined to imperatives, eg. abi dnm supr. 249.

De fallacia, see v. 533.

599. Immo (of. 770 and Eun. 355) here too retains something
of that negative sense which it has been already remarked is
always conveyed by it. Chremes says ‘she seems a very bad
woman indeed,'—Syrus answers: ‘Nay, but not only in the
sense you mean, you only go on what you have seen: if you
knew what Ι know then you might say so.⁷ For an example of
this use of inimo fully developed‚ see Plaut. Mil. 634—6,
PL. benignitas quidem liujus oppido adulescentuli-st. PE. Immo,
hospes, 771091'3 quum periculum facies, mayis nosces meam comi-
tatem erga te.

603. mabomst. αἶρραβών is properly ⁵ earnest-money,’ and
occurs in Aristotle (V. Poet. 1, 4, (5). It is here used in the
sense of ⁴ seeurity.’ It was also used for a pledge: cf. Plaut.
Mil. 4, 1, 11, where a ring is called arrabo amoris. Gellius
(4, 2) says that the word was out of date in his time, and arra
