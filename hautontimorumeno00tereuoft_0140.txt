796. Cicero quotes the proverb a little differently, de Off. 1,
10, ‘ Summumjus summa injuria‚’ sactum estjam tritum sermone
proverbium. Sec Soph. El. 1042, ἀλλ’ ἔστιν ἔνθα χή δίκη
βλάβην φέρει. Syrus' dignified remonstrance, and horror at
the idea of such a man as Chremes being guilty 01 sharp prac—
tice, is exceedingly humorous and well done, when we re-
member that he was cheating him all the time.

797. haud faciam, i.e. ‘1 will pay the money.’

798. Omnes te ἱη lauta esse et bene aucta re putant. ‘All
look upon you in the light of an opulent man with awell-
husbanded property.’ This is Bentley's verse. The old reading
was omnes in lauta et bene acta parte putant. This will not
scam—but one feels that Bentley's correction is not satis-
factory. rem anyere is an expression well known in Horace, as
110 shows [Ep. 1, 16, 683 1, 7, 51]: but some appeal to Chremes’
character is wanted to complete the sense, all Mss. but one have
ασῑᾶ instead of aucta, and Ι am inclined to think it should be
retained. rem affere is common enough. It would then per-
haps mean, ‘All look upon you as being in opulent circum-
stances and straightforward in conducting business) However,
being uncertain I have left the verse as Bentley wrote it.

799. immo, ‘ nay rather‚' cf. 94.

Acr IV. Sc. 6.

Chremes goes in to 101011 the money. Syrus is 1011 on the
stage alone. To him enters Clitipho from the walk on which
he had been sent. He is furious with Syrus3 but learns to his
surprise and (lelight that what he wanted, money to take to
Bacchis, has been obtained.

Clitipho returns from the walk (vid. 587) just in time to
receive the money Syrus' trick has got out of Chremes.

806. quam is equivalent to quum eam. Some read quom.
uel: ‘for instance‚' cf. on 540.
