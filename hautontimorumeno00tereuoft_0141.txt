formulas oi the sort being generally expressed in arc-haic lan-
guage. Cf. Hec‘. 134, Phorm. 123. See Roby ξ 589, 1592.

813. excamufices: eat-carnificare: ‘to tear the fiesh to
pieoes': it is here of course used in the metaphorical sense:
cf. Senec. de Ir. 314,eaecao·nz1ftcatzzs animus. carnifezz‘tor-
turer': cf. Pl. Bacch. 4, 4, 37, rapere aliquem ad carnificem .·
and in 651 Andr. it is used of one who causes mental torture.
ibin=ibfis-2ze, “off with you!’' Bentley ior tu, or in, as the
various iuss. read.

818. abiisti: mihi amicam adduxti, etc.: ‘You went your
way, you brought me a mistress whom I wasn't allowed to
touch.' Fleck. writes abin istinc ‘ Away with you 1 ’ for abiisti.
Bentl. wrote adisti mihi manum ‘you deceived me’ [comparing
Pl. Aul. 2, 8, 8, ita illis impuris omnibus adii manum} But
Clitipho is argumentative rather than reproachful. He had
just cursed Syrus and his plans, and he excuses this by arguing
⁴ See what you have done for me! you went away indeed in
my service, but you only brought me a mistress whom Ι wasn't
to touch.’ W. follows Fleckh. But Ι think the old reading
may safely be lest.

819. adduxti...quam non licitumst: obs. the subj. ‘such
a mistress as Ι mayn't touch.’

825. deamo te: ⁴1 am exceedingly fond of you, syrus)
⁸ Ι love you from the bottom of my heart.’ Cf. Plaut. Epid. 2,
2, 37, quam tuus 9natus...cleamat‚ deperit ubifidem remque
reque teque properat perdere. The intensive force of de in oom-
position with verbs is rare. Key, ξ 1327, quotes depopulari
‘lay thoroughly waste’; but seems to think that in these
cases the preposition was originally dis, comparing (lilaudare,
discupere. There do not seem to be good grounds ior this
opinion. Cf. debacchari [Adelph. 183] ‘to revel one's fill)
Desatiyare [Adelph. 51'9] ‘to utterly weary out.’ Demirari [sup.
362] ‘to wonder very much.’ And in the same category may
be placed deambulare [587] ‘to take a regular walk' See
Roby§ 1918. Decimo here is a strong expression of gratitude
as amo in 360. ne cf. on 222.

826. caue....sis=cc1ve ne...sieS. Like fac, cave often is
followed by the subj. without ut or ne, of. cave faxis 187.

827. obsecundato, sc. ei, ‘ fall in with his humour.’ ‘Hu-
mour him now, do what you will afterwardS.'
