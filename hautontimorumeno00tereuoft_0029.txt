THE LIFE OF TERENCE. xxv

who afterwards married a Roman knight3 also plea-
sure-grounds of twenty jngers on the Appian way near
the Villa stlartis. Which makes me wonder all the
more at Portins writing the lines: “Nothing did
“Scipio avail him, nothing Laelius, nothing Fortius,
“who were the three nobles who at that time lived in
“the greatest affluence 3 from their assistance he had
“not so much as an hired house, that there might at
“least be a place to which his poor slave might bring
“the news of his master’s death.''

ll. Afranius indeed prefers our author to all the
›Comic pects, writing in his Compitalia2²³; “saying
there is 110 other like Terence.⁷’ But Volcatius puts
him below not only Naevius and Plautus and Cae-
cilius, but also Licinius and Atiliusffl'.

12. Cicero 111 1110 Limon³⁰ gives him thus much
praise: ‘⁴ Yon too, Terence, who art the only one,
“that in choice language dost publish amongst us
“ illemmder translated and set forth in the Latin
“ tongue, ever polished in style and with words that
“are always sweet.’' Also Caius Caesar : “ You too,
“ you haltllxlenffliderffl, are placed in the highest rank

‘23 Lucius Afranius, a Roman Comic poet of the lst cen-
tury B.C. His comedies were descriptive of Roman life (eo-
moediae tenatiae), and the title of this one is taken from the
Roman festival, the Compitalia (lit. the festivales the Cress-
roads), which was celebrated early in -Januffly,

29 This classification of the Comic poets is quoted from
Vulcatius' work de Poeta, by Aulus Gellius, 15, 24. He
111-11111303 1110111 111 1110 following order of merit: Caecilius,
Plautus, Naevius, Licinius, Atilius, Terentius.

Licinius was born B. c. 82. And of Marcus Atilius nothing
is known except that he was an early Roman poet, of whose
works only a line 01 two lias been preserved. Terence seems
10 have looked upon Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius, as au-
thorities upon whose example he might rest. v. Andr. Prol.
18, qni qaum hanc accusant, Naevium Plautum Ennium
Accusant.
