PREFACE.

FEw if any of the Classical writers have been so
often copied and edited as Terence. In nearly every
considerable library in Europe one or more MS. copies
exist of his Works 3 and the name of the printed edi-
tions of his plays is legion¹. After the revival of
learning he was looked on as a model of pure Latinity,
and hjs writings were regarded as the best and most
necessary of Sohool books. Erasmus is said to have
learnb all the plays by hear‘c, and Wagner in his
preface quotes the opinion of Philip Melanchthon to
shew how excellent a model of style, and how ad-
mirable in moral tendency, the writings of Terence
were regarded by the schol-ars of that age. Of late,
however, Terence has certainly been less read, and
consequent-ly less edited. Bentley⁷s great edition of
1726 forms the starbing-point for all the more recent
editions3 and Fleckheisen (1865) marks his variations
from Bentley-'s texts as a standard. W. XVagner's

¹ The earliest printed edition is that of Milan² 1470. The
second, I think, that of Venice, 1479. Ι have had before me
a copy of the latter.
