before this made my ears deaf with your prayers.
What else do you want ‘l

CL1T. If indeed this is done.

SY. ‘If indeed' Ξ You shall know by experience.

CLIT. Come, come! favour us with that plan of

OLIT. Why there 2
SY. It would be too long a story if I were to tell

you why 1 do that3 but there is good reason.
GLIT. Nonsense l I see no valid reason for it being

to my advantage to undergo this alarin.

SY. Stay! I have something else, if you are afraid
of that, which you must both confess to be without
any risk.
