84 NOTES.

382. formae. Consimilis is generally without case, but
admits either the genitive or dative after it. Cf. 1024, Pl.
(ἔαρι. 4, 2, Cui homini nemo est consimilis. For construction
with gen. see Plaut. Capt. 1, 2, 7, and 14, (wis serae cona, and
below 394. In the passage quoted by W. to prove the form
isti (which he reads) for istius, the reading is disputed, PL
Τιίιε. 5, 38.

384. The Scholiast on the Bembine MS. quotes the cor-
{esppn—dxiixivg line of Menander, ἀνδρὸς χαρακτὴρ ἐκ λόγου ’γνωρί-

386. adeo. Vid.54 note.

385—390. Bacchis excuses the unfavourable contrast be-
tween her grasping and Antiphila's disinterested character, by
the usual plea of necessity. ⁶ It is very easy for you virtuous
women to let no money influence you, for you have a sure pro-
vision in the fidelity of your loven-oure only love us while we
are good-looking3 therefore unless we get money while we can,
we must starve when our bloom is past.' It is like Becky
Sharpe in Vanity Fair, saying, ‘⁴ I think Ι could be virtuous
on four thousand a-year.'’

388. bonas, ⁴ disinterestedss seems here to refer especially
to conduct regarding money. The use of bonitas Tac. Hist.
i. 52 is not unlike this.

389. amatores, ironical. ‘Our so-called lovers, who are
only cultores after all?

391. nisi 51, a pleonasm nearly equivalent to nisi. Cf. Cic.
Phil. 2, 28, 70, nisi si tu es solus Antonius, where see Mayor’s
note. desertae, i.e. ‘without lovers and therefore in want.’

393. mos consimilis nostrum, lit. ‘like you3’ we should
say ‘like yours 3 ' but this idiom, whereby a part of one thing
15 compared to the whole of another, instead of its correspond-
ing part, is common in both Greek and Latin, cf. 1024. hi,
i.e. this class of lovers.

394. utrique, the masculine plural still used because a
class 15 intended. See on 298. beneficio...ab utrisque, both
cxtensions of the predicate contained in devincimini: the
former denoting the ‘ instrument‚’ the latter the ‘ agent.'

400. tui carendum, elsewhere careo is constructed with
abl. Cf. 137, 357, in Plaut. Cure. 1, 2, 49, it has the accu-
sative, but perhaps that is a case of attraction.

401. Hocin, etc, ‘ To think I am so unhappy as not to be
able to enjoy such a heart in my own way? Cf. 504 and Ειιτι,
