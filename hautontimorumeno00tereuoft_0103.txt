N OTES. 71

by arms, aye, abroad in foreign war, I did not loiter at home.'
⁴ Home-staying youths have ever homely was?

Much difficulty has been made of this verse because the
editors have combined armis belli and translated it ‘feats of
war': which was felt to be a harsh and almost impossible
phrase. Even Wagner does this, though at the same time he
quotes the exactly parallel passage of Plautus (Epid. 3, 4, 13)
which gives the clue.

Nempe quem in adulescentia
Memorant apud reyes armis, arce bel-lica,
Diuitias magnas indeptum.

11 any alteration is required it would be that of bello for belli :
which would more exactly correspond with arte bellica.

Two other ways have been adopted. Some editors arrange
the line thus: Simul rem et belli ῃῑονὶαηι armis repperi: and
combine belli yloriam. But this alteration is unnecessary‚
destroys the neatness of the antithesis opem et 9Ζονίιιηι, and in-
troduces a phrase scarcely preferable to belli armis (in the
passage gloriam belli ueterem recuperare, Caes. B. G. vii. 1, the
presence of an adjective makes all the difference.)

A second attempt to emend the line is a still less happy one.
Madvig (Ememlationes Latinae p. 14) suggests belle. But belle
is not found elsewhere in Terence, and only twice for certain
in Plautus, (Curcul. 3, 5 is a disputed and almost hopeless
line.) and then with the sense of irony or playfulness which
was attached to it in later writers, Nil bene dumfcaecias‚fa-
cias tamen omnia belle, Mart. 2, 7, 8. And Chremes is speak-
ing in sober earnest, with no idea of irony. I have made no
alteration except in the stopping‚ therefore.

113. adeo here has the literal meaning of its compounds
acl-eo, ⁴ up to that point’ : ior the fact of ad· in this compound
being followed by the ablative, compare quoad, praeterea. See
Ramsay's Most. Excurs. 1, pp. 177—180.

115. Bentley writes the line, ‘putauit me et aetate et beneuo-
lentia.' Ι have retained sapientia because it is the reading ot*
the Bembine MS„ although beneuolentia seems the better word,
answering to prouidere plus, as aetate to plus scire, as Bentley
explains.

117. ad regem, one of those who succeeded to the eastern
part of Alexander's dominions. There is nothing to shew
which, nor does it matter. Going off to serve in Asia would
be a stock resource in Athens for young men of broken means,
cf. v. 59. The allusion, which of course does not suit Rome, is
taken unaltered from Menander. Lucian (Lovers’ Dial. p. 298)
