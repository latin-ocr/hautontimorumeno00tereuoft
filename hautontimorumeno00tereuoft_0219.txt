that l am angry with now, What a number of cir-
eumstanoes gave me the opportuity of discovering the
truth, if I had 1101, been a bloekhead l What *ohings
I saw! Dear me, how unlucky Ι am! But 011 my
saith they shall not get off so with impunity, if I live:
for I'll immediately. . .

ΜΕ. Have you no self-restraintz have you no 920
respec'o for yourself2 Am I not a sufficient warning
to you?

CH. I am beside myself for anger, Menedemus.

ΜΕ. Thass you should talk like that! Is it 1101, 6
disgrace that you should give advice to others, should
be wise abroad, withoub being able to help yourself ’1

CH. What am I to doz

ME. Just what you were saying that: 1 did not do
sufficiently. Take care that he feel ‘chat you are his
father 3 take care that he have eourage to confide
everything to you, to 6811 611(1 demand favours from
you ; lest he look out for some other means of supply
and desert] you.

CH. No, no : I had much rabher thal: he took him-
self off to any part of the world you please‚ than
remain here to reduce his father to poverty by his
wickedness: for if I prooeed to supply him in his 930
extravagances, Menedemus, I shall have matters corne
to the mattoek in good earnest.

ΜΕ. WVha'c a number of disagreeables 11111 you
bring upon yourself if you don⁷t take care ἶ You will
make 6 display of severiby‚ and nevertheless you will
pardon him afterwards, and that withou’c any thanks.
