able one in studying the Latin Comic writers I have
attempted no discussion or explanations of the metres
employed. I am quite awai-e of the importanee and
interest of this subject. But it is one which I think
will never satisfactorily be entered upon with young
students: nor have I anything fresh to add to the
numerous treatises to be found on it. If the English
schoolboy finds a difficulty in reconciling the prosody of
Terence with the rules which lie lias been taught from
Ovid, it is some consolation to know that he will not
be in 'a much worse case than Horace himself was in
regard to Plautus, Si modo 690 et vos Scimus imar-
bamam lepido seponere dicto, Leyitimwmque sonum

diqitis callemus et aure.
