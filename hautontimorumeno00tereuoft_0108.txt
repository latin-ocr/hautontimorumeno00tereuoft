Αο1· II. Sc. l.

Clitipho, left to himself, soliloquizes on the words just spo-
ken by his father. He complains of the different view taken
by old men as to the love affairs of their sons to those which
they formerly held when young themselves. He himself, how-
ever, is deeply involved with Bacchis, and is more moved by
the words of his mistress than of his father.

This serves to introduce the under plot of the play, isse. the
use made of Clinia's return to help Clitipho out of his difficul-
ties with Bacchis
