224. This verse is omitted by some, as not being found in
the Bembine MS.

227. potens, ‘rich and successful.’ Bentley wrote petant
for potens. Petam does not occur elsewhere in good authors,
but he supposes it to be coined for the sake of the alliteration.
Cf. Plaut. Pers. 3, 3, 6, Pecuniae accipites avide atquc invide,
Procax, rapax, traham where traham appears to be coined for
the sake of the alliteration. Fleck. reads impotens, Wagner
petens. For the sense of potens cf. Eun. 353, where it means
‘rich,’ and for its special application of ‘successful’ in love
see Ellis on Cat. 100, 8, sis in amore potens. procax, from the
old verb procor=posco. nobilis, ‘well-known,’ and therefore
fastidious, as a woman known and sought by many would be.

228. Tum, v. note to Prol. 22. recte is what Clitipho says
to Bacchis [not ⁴ thanks‚’said by Bacchis to Clitipho, as W. takes
it]. It is a word used evasively when the speaker knows not
what to answer. Of. 518 and Heeyr. 355. Transl. “As to
what I am to give her, Ι have nothing but to say ‘oh yes
certainly,’ for Ι daren’t confess to having nothing.'’ religio
est: (ἐνθύμιον) ‘I have scruples,’ cf. Andr. 94, 730. He calls
them ‘ scruples‘: what he means is that he has been afraid to
say that he has nothing, lest he should lose her favours.

229. hoc mali, sc. ‘having connection with such a woman.'
St. compares Pl. Mero. 2, 3, 23, where hoc malum means such
a connection. For the constr. ot hoc mali cf. 237.

Aci* Π. Sc. 2.

To Clitipho enter Clinia. He has sent Dromo to fetch
Antiphila and is very uneasy that they are so long coming.

232. ‘Many circumstances concur in strengthening this
opinion in my mind.'

This is Bentley's emendation of the Mss. which have con-
currant multae opiniones quae mihi animum eocauyeant. I am
not altogether satisfied of the necessity for the change. The
real difficulty is that if the Ms. reading is to stand, opiniones
must mean ‘grounds for opinion,’ of which meaning there are
no other examples. Bentley also says that ont'mwm exclamant
must refer to satisfaction, not distress. We have, however,
in Plaut. Stich. 1, 1, 56, maerore auyeor, where the reading
does not seem doubtful. The elder copyists and editors seem
not to have suspected opiniones so much as exazcyeant (which
