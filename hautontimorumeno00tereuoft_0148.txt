116 NOTES.

923. foris: ‘ out of doors,’ i. e. for every one but your-sels,
and in all matters but your own. For distinction between
soris and -cts see Baius. on Pl. Most. 1, 1, 1.

926. credere: Menedemus again quotes Chremes against
himself, vid. 156.

931. mihi anec...redit: ‘1 shall have matters come to the
mattock 111 good earncst.' Vero i.e. not by way of a fanciful
penance as you did, but from real necessity Ι shall have 1ο
work 011 1110 land for my living. For redit cf. 113, adeo res
rediit ‘matters have come 10 such a pass.' Phorm. 686, Ad
restim mi 1ιὶ quidem res redit planissume. ⁶ Matters have clearly

come to the halter with ine‚’ ἵζε. I must hang myself. See
also 359, 980. Redit for redibit cf. 872, 804.

934. ingratum: cf. gyratam, 362.

936. adfines are ‘relations by marriage.⁹ Cf. Megadorus
meus affinis, τ’. e. ⁴ my son-in-law,' Plaut. Aul. 3, 4, 14.

937. dixisse filio. For this sense of dico, cf. Plaut. Mil. 3,
1, 112, mea bona morte mea ooqnatis dicam. And Cic. Εἰ. 35,
pecuniam omnem suam doti dicit.

938. Dotis: Chremes repeats the word dotis in an absent
manner, and Menedemus thinks he is annoyed at the idea, and
therefore at once answers that he doesn’t care about the
amount. The word however had suggested to Chremes a way
of punishing his 5011.

940. duo talenta, the amount Chremes had speculated
upon having to pay. V. 933. It is about 58450.

942. doti dixisse 1111. Cf. note on 937. 1111, i. e. to Clinia.

944. uero refers to simulato. ⁶ Pretend! why it's no pre-
tence, Ι really don't know.‘

946. diffluit: like a river overflowing its banks. St. quotes
Cic. Off. 1, 30, diffluere luxuria et delicate ac molliter uiuere.
Almost in the sanie sense Persius (iii. 20) sayS, effluis amens.
retundam, lit. ‘to hammer back’3 hence ‘to cheek’ Cf.
Phaeclr. 4, 22, 21, superbiam retundere. Cic. Art. 15, 15, belle
iste puer retundit Antonium. St. redigam: “ rediyo used ab·
solutely without in or ad, or some other preposition, is very
rare.''—MUNn0 on Lucr. i. 553.

947. gerere mihi morem: ‘to please myself‚' yerere morem
alicui (from which the verb moriyeror or -o is formed, vid.
Adelph. 218) means to ‘suit one’s manners to another,' hence
to ⁴ please,’ ⁶ give 111 10.’ Τ]10 bad sense of fiattery or servility
in which Bacon uses the word 15 later. Of course its use with
a reflexive pronoun is rarer, and is a mark of Comic language.
