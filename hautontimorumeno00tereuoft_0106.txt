74 NOTES.

Chremcs’ house, another Phania’s house, and another pro-
bably Menedemus’.

173. quid crepuerunt fores. As the stage-doors—after the
Greek fashion—-opened outwards, a person coming out tapped
the door to give notice to passere-by: the doors of private
dwellings in Rome did not open cumanis, but as in other
things we have the Greek custom alluded to. Ι suppose that
Chremes so stands as by the opening door to be hidden from
his son, who is coming out, until he has shut the door again,
but to be seen by the audience.

174. This line is wanting in the Bembine MS.

a me ; ‘in my house,' for this use of α ‘on the side of‚' cf.
13. α me is the correlative of apud me.

Aer. Ι. So. 2.

Chremes overhears his son talkingto some one in the house.
and on questioning him learns that it is Clinia, Menedemus’
lamented son, who has returned from the wars. He takes the
opportunity of lecturing Clitipho on the duties of a son.

175. adhuc...etiam. i. e. it is not yet time to think them
guilty of unnecessary delay; they couldn’t be here yet. etiam
adhuc sometimes are used together for stronger emphasis,
Cf. Plaut. Amph. 1, 1, 92, Nunquam etiam quicquam adhucuer-
borum est prolocutus perperam. cessant, i. e. Antiphila, and
Dromo who has been sent for her.

185. amplius, ‘ How I wish Menedemus had been more
pressed to dine with us.’ Some take this with esset: ut esset
amplius, ‘that he might be with us besides the other guests.'
Wagner gives good and sufficient reasons against this, though
he curiously puts a comma after imitatum, which would seem
to eompel us to take esset amplius together.

187. caue faxis: ‘Mind you don’t do so? In the older
stages of the Latin language there was a future indicative in
-so and snbj.-s1·m formed from the stem of verbs. In verbs
with -a or -e stem the s was doubled, amasso, habessit. With
consonant or -i stems -so -sz'm is added to the final consonant
of the stem. ausim and faxim, (fac-sim). There are many of
these forms found, but Terence only uses faxo, fascis, ausim,
ausis, excessis, appellassis. And after his time all but faxo —is,
ausim -z‘s are very rare. Roby, ξ 620.

183. He might even now run away.
191. seruolum. Dromo.
