68 NOTES.

what we should call the ‘lucidity’ os his style. And Cicero
(Orat. 75. 262) talks of a pura ct illustris bremens, “Brevity
which is at once clear and explicit.”

48. pretium. Pliny (N. II. viii. 39, ξ, 128) mentions a tra-
dition that Roscius earncd as much as 500 sertertia (about
,ξ’-1000) a-year by his acting.

48—50. Wagner omits these lines, as they do not appear
in the Bembine ms. They arc in the second prologue of the

Hecyra.

51. exemplum: shew by giving me a quiet hearing that
you regard devotion to the public service and reward it, and
thus encourage young actors to do their best, as I have done.

Chremes finding Menedemus (the Havton timornmenos)
engaged, as he had often noticed him before, in the most
laborious operations of the farm, remonstrates with him on
the unsuitableness and uselessness of such conduct at his time
of life, and by questioning him, draws from him the history of
his proceedings. Menedemus says that having by undue
severity driven his only son to leave home and go out for a
soldier, he has determined to enjoy none of the luxuries, of
which his son is deprived, but to punish himself by the most
servile work until his son returns.

53. nupera. I have adopted this reading instead of nuper,
which it would be difficult to justify. Facciolati quotes one
other passage, in which the same doubt existed as to the read<
ing between nuper and nuperi, Flor. 4, 2. In the passage of
Cicero (Fin. 2, 4, 14), where it is quoted, some of the old
editions read nupera.

54. quom, ‘since the time that‚' cf. Mero. 3, 1, 35, iam
biennium est quom mecum rem coepit. 44, haud sane diu est
quum (lentes exciderunt. Fleckheisen’s emendation for quod, the
reading of the MSS-z VVagner's emendation is ex quo. adeo
emphasizes the word after which it comes, V. Conington’s
note to Virg. Ecl. iv. 11.

55. rei, ‘intercourse’ Cf. Hecyr. 718, Minitemur si cum
illo habuerit rem postea ; and Liv. v. 3, seruis uetant quicquam
rei cum alienis hominibus esse.

that I may venture3 ‘like an intimate‚' because our being such
near neighbours makes me feel like one.
