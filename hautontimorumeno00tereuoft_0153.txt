1009. restas :rests-tis, ‘ hold out against,' ‘ resist‚' Plaut. Most.
5, 2, 50, ut restat furcifer! where Weise quotes Propert. 3,
8, 31, Dum vincunt Danai, dum restat barbarus Hector. Cf.
Ov. M. 3, 626, Is mihi dum resto iuvenili yuttara pugmo Rupit.

1010. Immo scis, ‘Nay then! I'll acknowledge that you
know, or anything else, to prevent your beginning all over
again with your elatter) de integro redire, cf. ratio de in-
tngro inezmdast mihi, 675.

1011. postules. Cf.671.

1014. subditum : ‘ supposititious' St. quotes Liv. 40, 9,
Me subditum et pellice {lenitam appellant.

1015. inimicis. ‘Hushl in heaven’s name! leave that to
our enemies.' A common formula of deprecation. Cf. Virg-

1016. qui sit meus: obs. the subjunctive ‘ a son who is
really mine.' Not, this particular son.

1018—1020. The words between brackets are considered by
Wagner and others to be an interpolation. Madvig however
argues that if they had been introduced by any one, he would
at least have written a complete verse; that they are to the
point and present no sign of interpolation. He thinks that
some words have been lost and that they originally stood in
somewhat this way :

Sed quum mayis credundum siet
indidem esse oriundum id, quod est consimile moribus,
convinces etc.

1018. Quod filiast inuenta ἱ) i. e. ‘ Do you sneer at my faculty
for convincing people that they are my children, because I have
just discovered a long-lost daughter?’ This is Colman’s ex-
planation ε and it is a better one than that given by Madame
Dacier and others, who explain it to mean: ‘Do you mean
{hat my discovery of a daughter will prove me not to be

arren?’

1021. nil...re1.ictum huic etc. seems to mean something like
this: ‘If all his faults were reckoned and balanced against
yours, he would have no surplus on his side‚’ i. e. ‘ he has no
fault which you have not.' For the construction, cf. qaid
reliqui est quin habeat qzme...dz'cuntur bona, 193.

1023. quam seuerus! rem cum uideas, censeas. (Of. 599.)
This is said sarcastically: ‘how grave and proper he looks!
If you only knew all about his conduct with Bacchis, you'd
think he was so indeed l‘ St. quotes Plaut. Oasin. 3, 2, 32:
secl eccum incedit! ut quum aspicias tristem, fruyi censeas.
