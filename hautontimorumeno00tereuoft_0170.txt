14 THE SELF—TORMENTOR.

Cn. Ι will tell you. Whatever were the eircum-
stzmcos, he ought nevertheless to have remained.
Perhaps he was somewhat more severe than suited
your friend's caprice : he should have put up with it:
for whom should he have borne with if not with his
own father 2 which was right, that this youth should
have suited. his manner of life to lais habits, or the
father to hisce And as to his pretending that he was
hard, that is not the case: for the severities of fathers
are mostly of one sort, in the case of a man who is fairly
tolerant. They wouldn't have them constantly with
women, they wouldn’t have them constantly at wine,
they supply them sparingly with cash: and all these
things are nevertheless with a view to their virtue.
But when the mind has once enslaved itself to wioked
lust, it needs must be, Clitipho, that it betakes itself
to wicked com-ses. This is the wise thing to do‚——to

210 gain at the expense of others, experienoe of what is to

your own advantage.

CL. So 1 suppose.

CH. I will go away indoors, to see how our dinner
is getting on. MincL please, considering the time of
day, that you don't go anywhere far out of the way.
