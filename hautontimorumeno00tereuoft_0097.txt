NOTES. 65

16. distulerunt=‘spread abroad.’ differo is used abso-
lutely for ‘to defames Cf. Tac. A. i. 4, dominos uariis rumori-
bus differunt. maleuoli are Lauinius and his adherente, who
seem to have had striet ideas as to the proper manner of using
the Greek originals3 and to have objected to Terence that he
‘eontaminated' too freely‚ and also took advantage of the
labours of previous Latin poets.

17. contaminasse: contamen ‘ contact’ is derived from
con- (oum) and ΐαῃίφηρη, from Taq- the root of tanao. It was
the teehnical term for the combining two or more plays into
one. Cf. Amlr. prol. 15, where the poet discusses the same
charge, and defends himself by the example set by Naeuius,

. Plautus, and Ennius.

19. autumo is the emphatic opposite of weyo. The deriva-
tion of the word is uncertain. Gellius (15, 3) quotes the
opinion of Nigidius that it was from ab-aestumo=t0tum aestu-
mO. But he points out that autumozdico et opinor et censeo,
whieh do not agree with this derivation. It is said also to be
from Au, probably another form of ‹zi-0. Cf. neyumo from
neae.

20. exemplum bonorum: cf. Andr. prol. 18: Qui quum
hunc accusant Naeuium, Plautum, Ennium Accusant, quos hic
noster auctores habet.

21. quod illi fecerunt, i. e. adapted Greek originale as they

Ple23÷edd¹um merely marks the transition to another point in
the address. Cf. Virg. G. iii. 357. uetus poeta, Lauinius,

Of. Phorm, prol. 1.

23. repente, ‘by a sudden freak;’ asse. without a regular
preparation for the profession. Repente is used os sudden
transformation, begun and ended instantaneously. As applied
to the appearance of a man as a writer without due prepara-
tion we may compare Persius⁷ prol. 3 :

Neo in bicipiti somniasse Parnasso
Memini, ut repente sic poeta prodirem.

Compare also Cic. Phil. 2, ξ 65, persona de mimo modo egens
repente diues. So too, repemina nobilitas in Livy i. 34,
means rank that comes to a man without previously belonging
to his aneestors, by some one act of his own. Studium musi-
cum: “the profession of a dramatist,'’ as he calls the ‘dra-
matie art’ ars musica, Plzorm. pr. 17, Hecyr. pr. 2, 15. It
represents the Greek μουσική, which was one of the three parts
of education, the other two being γραμματική and γυμναστική,
