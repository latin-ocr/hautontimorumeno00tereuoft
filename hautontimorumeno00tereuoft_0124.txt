521. Aquilae senectus. Facciolati quotes two explanatione
of this proverb. 1. That it is applied to old men who are
fond of drink, from a tradition that in its old age, its beak be-
coming too 010οκοᾱ to tear, the eagle lives on the blood only
of its prey. 2. That it is synonymous with ‘ a green old age,'
because of the long-continued vigour of the eagle. Parry
quotes a Greek proverb, ἀετοῦ ’γῆρας κορύδου νεότης. ‘the eagle’s
age is as fresh as the lark's youth.’ The application here is
either ‘ you seemed to me to drink like an old eaglc,’ or, ‘you
seemed to be as fresh to your work (i.e. drinking) as an old
eagle.’ Cf. Shakespeare, Timon, 4, 3, 222:

“ Will these mossed trees
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels ?’'

523. luculenta: ‘bright and graceful.' Cf. Plaut, Mil. 4,

well! The words and tone express depreciation. Cf. 457.

Andr. 804, satine recte? M. nosue? sic. “ Is all going on
well ? '' M. “ Do you mean with us ἱ) So-so.'’

524. nunc z ‘now-a-days.’ Syrus takes his tone from
Chremes, and fiatters the old man, a laudator temporis acti, by

hinting that of course in his young days women were hand-
somer. Bentl.

525. deperit hanc: depereo, though an intransitive verb,
takes in this sense of ‘dying for love of’ an accusative: like
