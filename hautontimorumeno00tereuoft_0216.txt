Ao'r V. Sc. 1.

Emer MENEDEMUS.

ΜΕ. [soliloq] I know well enough that I *am not
so very acute or so very sharp-sighted: but this
Chremes who undertakes to assist and advise and
point out consequences tome, he outdoes me in this.
Against me, any of those terms which are the epithets
given to a fool apply‚—blockhead‚ log, ass, leaden:
but none of them can apply to him3 for he goes be-
yond all these by his folly.

CH. [talkiny to his wife in the house as he comes
out] Oh there, wife} pray stop worrying the gods

880 with your thanks, that your daughter has been dis-

covered : unless you so judge of the gods by your own
character, as to believe that they understand nothing,
unless it be repeated a hundred times, But meanwhile
why is my son lingering there all this time with
Syrus 2

ME. [comianorward] What persons do you say
are linger-ing, Chremesl

CH. Ah, Menedemus, are you come? Did you give
Clinia my messagel

ΜΕ. Everything. CH. What says hes}

ME. He began to express great joy exactly like
persons who are eager for marriage.

CH. Ha! ha! ha! ME. Why laugh?
