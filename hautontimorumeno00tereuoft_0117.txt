Ν OTES. 85

644, Hocine tam audax: [facinus facere esse ausum! “To
think 01 his having dai-ed to commit so audacious a crime ! ”
This use of the infinitive in an exclamatory sentence may be
compared with a similar use in Greek. See Arist. Ναὶ). 268,
τὸ δὲ μηδὲ κυνῆν οἴκοθεν ἐλθεῖν ἐμὲ τὸν κακαδαίμον’ ἔχοντα. “ ΤΟ
think of my being so unlucky as to have come from home with-
out even my cap !’' 819, τὸ Δία. νομίζειν ὄντα τηλικουτονί, “ to
think 01 believing in Zeus at your age!” Aves 5, τὸ δ’ ἐμὲ
καρώνῃ πειθόμενον τὸν ἄθλιον Ι ὅδου περιελθεῖν στάδια πλεῖν ἣ
χίλια. “To think of my being so miserable as to have gone
a round 01 more than a thousand stades in obedience to a

raven ἱ ”
401. frui ingenium, cf. note to 66.

403. Immo ut patrem tuom uidi esse habitum, dia etiam
turbas dabit. “So far from that,—according to what I see your
father's disposition to be, he will give you trouble for a good
while yet.⁷' For the sense 01 ut cf. 436, Non ῐιι (11113ῐί ut
essem. Habitum esse for se habere is unusual but intelhgible,
and there seems little gained by altering it to habitu esse, as
Madvig does [Emendat. Lat. p. 15]. Fleckheisen adopts an
emendation turbas for duras, which Madvig thinks unneces-
sary. Dure turbas occurs elsewhere in Terence, and clare
duras does not; but that will hardly justify the change.
Duras is usually explained as standing for duras partes,- bnt
Madvig explains it as duras aures, “ears deas to entreaties.⁷’
But see Ean. 354, Duras fratris partes praedicas. Immo has
always a negative or corrective sense. Here it corrects meo
modo frui, ⁴ Enjoy her in your own way l far from that3 your
father will prevent that for some time.'

We must notice that Syrus is either purposely misrepresent-
ing Menedemus' state 01 feeling, 01· being in ignorance 01 it
hazards a statement to induce Clinia to keep up the conceal-
ment long enough to enable him to execute his plan 01 getting
the money.

403. Ah, retine me, ‘ Hold me up (I faint) ! ’ Antiphila
sees Clinia, and litters a long startled cry, as though the unex-
pected joy were too much for her.

404. Disperii perii: perii! as a mere exclamation of sur-
prise, whether agreeable or otherwise, we have had before,
220, 246. For the strengthened form, disperii! compare 970.
amabo, ‘Prayl’ like sis, varies in meaning according to the
tone in which it is uttered. Here it is said coaxingly, as one
woman would speak to another whom she saw triglitened and
faint: and this Ellis (011 Catul. 32, 1) shows to be its proper
