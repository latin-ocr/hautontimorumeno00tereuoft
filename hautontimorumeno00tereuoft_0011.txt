PREFA OE. v ii

in the Oxford University Library. And with this in-
formation Ι have been obliged to be content. Though
taking Fleckheisen's text in the main, Ι have yet re-
tained the older reading, where using my best con-
sideration I have come to the conclusion either that
the alteration was not necessary, or not sufficiently
supported by authority, or that an alteration being
required, the right one had yet not been hit on ¹.
Since the publication of Wagner's edition, Madvig's
Emendatloms Latinoe have appeared, containing several
important emendations and remarks on the text of
Terence. These I have referred to in my notes. As
to my Commentary, which has been written with a
view rather to illustrate the meaning of Terence than
to discuss the genuineness of the text (though that
subject could not be wholly omitted), I have had before
me various works fron] all of which I have learnt
much. The edition of VVesterhovius (1726) contains
the opinions of the ancient grammarians, that of stall>
baum (1831) contains nearly all the illustrative matter
used by his successors. The most satisfactory help,
however, to the study of an author, is a complete con-
cordance or index: this is supplied by the Delphin
edition and by Parry, and this I have used con-
tinually. Zeune's edition (1774) Ι have not seen.

¹ My text differs from Fleckheisen's in the following
places: v. 5, 53, 112, 154, 169, 185, 216, 227, 232, 253, 238.
After 289 signs of lacuna omitted. 290, 300, 402, 458, 5:58,
597, 612ffi13, 628, 645, 818, 854, 997, 1006.
