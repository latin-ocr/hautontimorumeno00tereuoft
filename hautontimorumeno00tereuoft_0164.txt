S THE SELF-TORMENTOR.

CH. But meantime however put down this mat-
tock here: ‹lon't go on working.

ΜΕ. Certainly not.

CH. Why, what is the object?

ΜΕ. Allow me to give myself no moment's holiday

90 from work.

On. I won't allow you, Ι say. [Takes the mactoclc
away]

ΜΕ. Ah, you are not fair!

CH. [listinq Hae mattock} What! such a heavy one
as this, I pray‘l

ΜΕ. It is just what I deserve.

CH. [lays down the matcoclc] Now speak.

ΜΕ, Ι have an only son, who is quite a young
man t—ah‚ what did Ι say? that Ι leave? Rather, Ι laad,
Chremes: now it is doubtful whether Ι have one or no.

CH. What do you mean by that 2

ΜΕ. You shall know. There is here a stranger
from Corinth, a needy old lady: her daughter he
began to be desperately in love with, to such a degree
that he regarded her almost in the light of a wife 3—
all this was without my knowledge. XVhen I dis-
covered what was going on Ι began to treat him, not

100 kindly nor as the love-siok heart of a young man
should have been treated, but with violence, and in
the stale old way of fathers, Ι kept finding fault with
him every day ε ‘ So Ι do you expect to be allowed any
longer such liberties while Ι your father am alive, as
to regard a mistress almost in the light of a wife?
You are wrong if you believe that, and don't know
me, Clinia. Ι am willing that you be called my son
