114 NOTES.

885. Gaudere adeo...quasiqu1: ‘He began to express de-
light exactly as one would who was eager for marriage) Adeo
qnasi is a rare combination ‘just in the way in whieh‚' ita ut
qui 288. Menedemus pretends ironically to think that Clinia
was only seigning joy to take him in.

887. Voltus quoque fingit scelus: ‘The rascal makes up
people's faces too,⁷ i.e. as well as verba (Sall. J. 14), ‘he not only
makes up false tales but faces too.' Ironice. ⁴ He is so cunning
that he contrived to make my son look as if he was pleased ! '
In the opposite sense we have vero vultu (Andr. 839) ‘with a
natural expression of countenance,’ i.e. not assumed. scelus
for scelestus cf. 315, 740.

889. Veterator, sc. Syrus. veterator, ‘one who has grown
old and skilled 111 a thing,' ‘ an old hand‚⁷ as we say. Cf. in
causis privatis satis veterator, Cic. Brut. 41, 178. Hence
‘cunning’; cf. acutus, versutus, veterator, Cio. Fz‘n. 2, 16, 53.
si noris, ‘you’d think so all the more if you knew more.' noris
= noveris, i. e. if you knew that he had cheated you, not me.

892. iniecisse verba: injicere, or injicere verba=‘to hint,'
‘ suggest! Cf.Cic. Art. 16, 5, Bruto quamsaepe injecissem (le ὁμο-
πλοίᾳ. scilicet...in.iecisse...Dromonem: for construction see
note on 358.

893. See 778.

Ἴ89Ζ4. Nil prorsum: ‘absolutely nothing.' Cf. 776, prorsum
nl IL ¹0

895. instare, sc. filiam.- we must understand scilicet or
inquam from the preceding sentences.

896. 116 is quidem : ‘did not he either say anything?' Cf.
Cic. Phil. 2, 5, 11; ozon tractabo ut consulem : ne ille quidem
‘geigtetmconsularem. Seu, Ep. 5, Non splendeat toya ne sordeat

898. finxit: quoting Menedemus' own words, v. 887.

899. subolat: as though from subolo of the third coniuga-
tion. The only form which seems to be used is the third person
impersonal. The construction is subolet alicui, ‘ a person gets
scent of ’z cf. Phor-m. 474, Numquid subolet patri? Later mss.
read suboleat.

900. osculari atque amplexari: τ’. e. on the part of Bacchis

and Clitipho, which no doubt—says Menedemus sarcastically
—was all pretence l

902. conclaue is properly an apartment which may be
locked up with one key (clavis). ultimis 111 aedibus taken in
