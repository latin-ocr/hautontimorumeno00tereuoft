NOTES. '75

192. ille, i.e. Clinia. crederes. The old reading was
credere est, but as there are no examples of the construction,
the editors have changed it to crederes. Cf. Adelph. 628.

193. Quid relicuist, etc. ‘⁴ What is there left for him to
have ἱ) ” relicuist‚ cue. reliqui est.

196. Chremes is the ‘ heavy father,’ who misses no oppor-
tunity of moralizing‚ and lives to have his own sayings used
against him. A common character in dramatic literature.

197. importunus ,is properly ‘ out of place! Hence, one
who makes no proper allowance, but crosses everyone‘s humour.

198. plus satis: ‘more than enough ’ς for plus, amplius,
minus without quam or an ablative following v. Zumpt ἓ 485.

200. 111101116--ἱῑῐί66-716, and illic is here nominative. The
old reading was illene. 1111, sc. Menedemus,

mansum oportuit, i.e. mamam esse oportuit, where man-
sum is used as an impersonal. ‘It should have been re-
mained by him.' Itis a common construction in the Comic
poets, without esse.. Cf. 243, 635, and Adelph. 214, adulescenti
morem ,aestum opertui t.

201. praeter lubidinem, ‘more severe than suited his
caprice? Cf. 59, praeter aetatem tuam.

204. insimulat: ‘as to his pretending,' al. insimulant,
‘as to people pretending.’

205. tolerabilis, ‘tolerant‚' referring to the father. This
active use of tolerabilis may be compared with Terence’s use
of placabilis, See Adelph. 608, te ‘ips-zan puram-e ipsi coram
placabilius est. ‘To excuse yourself in an interview is more
likely to appense him! Cf. Phorm. 961. Plaut. Mil. 1144
dare operam acliatabilem: ib. 544 incoqritabilis. See Madvig,
Emeacl. Lat. p. 15. For the sentiment comp. Cic. Cluent. 6 ἓ 17,
Facile intclligyo 71οη modo reticere homines parentum injurias,
sed etiam animo aequo ferre oportere. Sed <⁷90 ea, quae ferri
possum ferencla; qnae taceri, tacenda esse arbitror. Parry
quotes Colman:

 

‘⁴ The severities of fathers,
Unless perchance a hard one here and there,
Are much the same: they reprimand their sons
For riotous excess.⁷’

210. periclum...faeere: the phrase facere per1'culum=‘ to
make an experiment or essay’ occurs again in Eun. 3, 1, 23.
facere periculam ex aliis is probably a phrase from gambling
or speculation : ⁴ to make one‘s essay with the goods of others‘:
in a moral sense, ‘to leam from the experieuce of others.'
