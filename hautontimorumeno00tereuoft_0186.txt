ACT ΠΙ. Sc. 1.

'Imm—tlte morning( after che last Act.

&mn—in from qf MENEDEMUS'S house.

Eozter CHREMES (md MENEDEMUS οη defferent sides.

CH. [soliloq] The day is already breaking there
[looks up to the sky} why delay to knock at my neigh-
bour’s door, that he may learn the news of his son’s
return from me before anyone else? although I per-
ceive that the young man does not wish this. But
when Ι see my friend here so tortured by his going
away, am I to conceal so unlooked-for a joy, when
there is no danger to the former from betraying him‘l
I will not do so ε for as far as my power will go I will
assist the old man. J ust as Ι see that my son is
serving the interests of his friend and contemporary,
and acting as his ally in his affairs 3 so we old men
also ought 111 fairncss to support other old men.

> ME. [soliloq.]. Either Ι am 111 disposition unusually

fitted by nature for misery3 or this saying is false,
which I hear commonly said, that time lessens sorrow
for men : for 111 my case at any rate my sorrow about
my son daily grows greater and greater 3 and the
longer he is absent, so much the more do I long for
him, and the more do I miss him.
