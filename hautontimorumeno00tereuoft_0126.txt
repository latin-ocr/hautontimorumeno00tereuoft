94 NOTES.

Syrus is supposed not to know how eager Menedemus is to
give it; and Chremes therefore urges him to persuade Dromo
to get it by a trick from the father lest his son Clinia run
away again for want of it; whom Chremes supposes to be
in exactly the same plight as his own son Clitipho really is,
v. 227—229.
